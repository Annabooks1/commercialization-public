# Standards for a highly secure Windows 10 device
These standards are for general purpose desktops, laptops, tablets, 2-in-1â€™s, mobile workstations, and desktops. This topic applies specifically and uniquely for **Windows 10 version 1709, Fall Creators Update**. Windows security features are enabled when you meet or exceed these standards and your device is able to provide a highly secure experience. 

## Hardware

| Feature | Requirement | Details |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Processor generation | Systems must be on the latest, certified silicon chip for the current release of Windows | <ul><li> Intel through 7th generation Processors (Intel i3/i5/i7/i9-7x), Core M3-7xxx and Xeon E3-xxxx and current Intel Atom, Celeron and Pentium Processors</li> <li>AMD through the 7th generation processors (A Series Ax-9xxx, E-Series Ex-9xxx, FX-9xxx)</li></ul>|
| Process architecture | Systems must have a processor that supports 64-bit instructions | Virtualization-based security (VBS) features require the Windows hypervisor, which is only supported on 64-bit IA processors, or ARM v8.2 CPUs |
| Virtualization | <ul><li> Systems must have a processor that supports Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) device virtualization and all I/O devices must be protected by IOMMU/SMMU</li><li>Systems must also have virtual machine extensions with second level address translation (SLAT)</li><li> The presence of these hardware virtualization features must be unmasked and reported as supported by the system firmware, and these features must be available for the operating system to use </li></ul> | <ul><li>For IOMMU, the system must have Intel VT-d, AMD-Vi, or ARM64 SMMUs</li><li> For SLAT, the system must have Intel Vt-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT), or AMD-v with Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI)</li></ul> |
| Trusted Platform Module (TPM) | Systems must have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), version 2.0, and meet the latest Microsoft requirements for the [Trustworthy Computing Group(TCG)](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/) specification  | Intel (PTT), AMD, or discrete TPM from Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Nuvoton |
| Platform boot verification | Systems must implement cryptographically verified platform boot | Intel Boot Guard in Verified Boot mode, or AMD Hardware Verified Boot, or an OEM equivalent mode with similar functionality |
| RAM | Systems must have 8 gigabytes or more of system RAM |   |

##Firmware
| Feature | Requirement | Details |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Standard | Systems must have firmware that implements Unified Extension Firmware Interface (UEFI) version 2.4 or later | For more information, see [United Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware requirements](OEM-UEFI.md) and [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Forum specifications](http://uefi.org/specifications) |
| Class | Systems must have firmware that implements UEFI Class 2 or UEFI Class 3 | For more information, see [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Forum specifications](http://uefi.org/specifications) |
| Code integrity | All drivers shipped inbox must be Hypervisor-based Code Integrity (HVCI) compliant | For more information, see the Enable virtualization-based isolation for Code Integrity section of [Driver compatibility with Device Guard in Windows 10](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windows_hardware_certification/2015/05/22/driver-compatibility-with-device-guard-in-windows-10/) |
| Secure boot | System's firmware must support UEFI Secure Boot and must have UEFI Secure Boot enabled by default | For more informaion, see [UEFI firmware requirements](OEM-UEFI.md) and [Secure Boot](OEM-secure-boot.md) |
| Secure MOR | System's firmware must implement Secure MOR revision 2 | For more information, see [Secure MOR implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/device-guard-requirements) |
| Update mechanism | Systems must support the Windows UEFI Firmware Capsule Update specification | For more information, see [Windows UEFI firmware update platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/windows-uefi-firmware-update-platform) |
