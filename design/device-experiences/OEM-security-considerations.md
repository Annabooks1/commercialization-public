#Security considerations for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
As an OEM you have an unique opportunity to impact the efficacy of the security measures abailable to your customers. Customers want and need the ability to secure their devices. Windows 10 security features are built on top of security enabled hardware and firmware. That's where you come in. If you want to provide a differentiator for your devices, or to sell in the Enterprise space, you want to provide the latest hardware enhancements, which in turn allow Windows 10 to be configured for safety. The following section describes the security hardware you should include in your systems and why.

**Note:** If you are an IT Professional and want to deploy these features, learn more in the [Device Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/) content.
