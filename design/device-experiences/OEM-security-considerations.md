#Security considerations for OEMs
As an OEM you have an unique opportunity to impact the efficacy of the security measures abailable to your customers. Customers want and need the ability to secure their devices. Windows 10 security features are built on top of security enabled hardware and firmware. That's where you come in. If you want to provide a differentiator for your devices, or to sell in the Enterprise space, you want to provide the latest hardware enhancements, which in turn allow Windows 10 to be configured for safety. The following sections describe the security hardware you should include in your systems and why.


Each section (one per feature) contains the following information.
1. Describe each feature and what it does. Link to more information if available. 
2. What are the OEM opportunities for each feature?
3. What are the OEM requirements for each feature?
4. Note that this is not IT Pro or consumer content, link to such if available.

You as the OEM have an unique opportunity to ensure that customers buying Windows 10 devices can securly set up their devices. Here's an explanation of hardware considerations for you to configure.
