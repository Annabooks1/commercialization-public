# Group


`Group` specifies the name of an existing local security group to which a new [LocalAccount](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-offlineuseraccounts-offlinelocalaccounts-localaccount.md) will be added during installation. You can add a user to multiple groups by entering multiple group names separated by semicolons.

The [Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup](microsoft-windows-shell-setup.md) component recognizes the following English group names and sets the appropriate localized group name, regardless of the default language of the Windows image:

-   AccountOperators

-   Administrators

-   BackupOperators

-   Guests

-   PowerUsers

-   PrintOperators

-   Replicator

-   SystemOperators

-   Users

Specify the account names and group names by using language-neutral names. The language-neutral account and group names are specified in English—for example, **Administrators**, **Power Users**, and **Guest**. This is required because the shell account settings are processed before a default user interface (UI) language is applied to the computer.

## Values


<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><em>Group_name</em></p></td>
<td><p>Specifies the existing local security group for the local account. More than one group can be specified (separated by semicolons). <em>Group_name</em> is a string with a maximum length of 256 characters.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

This string type supports empty elements.
