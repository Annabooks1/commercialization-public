<td><p>[Custom HTTP headers for Microsoft Edge](custom-http-headers-for-internet-explorer.md)</p></td>
<td><p>Partners can configure Microsoft Edge to send custom HTTP headers, in addition to the default HTTP headers, with all HTTP and HTTPS requests. The header is the portion of the HTTP request that defines the form of the message.</p></td>

<td><p>The user agent string indicates which browser you are using, its version number, and details about your system, such as operating system and version. A web server can use this information to provide content that is tailored for your specific browser and phone.</p>
<p>The user agent string for the browser cannot be modified. By default, the string has the following format:</p>
<p><code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows Phone 10.0; Android 4.2.1; &lt;Manufacturer&gt;; &lt;Device&gt;) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Mobile Safari/537.36 Edge/12.10166</code></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>[WAP browser support](wap-browser-support.md)</p></td>
<td><p>For phones that will ship in China and India, OEMs can add one preloaded WAP browser to the phone, which will automatically be launched when the user tries to open a WAP link. The WAP browser must be written as an application, and must go through the standard Windows Store submission process.</p></td>
