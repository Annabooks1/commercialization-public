# Dismiss the last USSD waiting dialog


Dismiss the last USSD waiting dialog in the case where there is a sequence of USSD or SIM app dialogs.

This customization affects the behavior of USSD dialog sequencing. It dismisses the last **Waiting…** dialog in the case where there is a sequence of USSD or SIM app dialogs. OEMs may need to configure this customization in cases where there is a sequence of two or more SIM app dialogs and where the OS might display a **Waiting…** dialog indefinitely and the dialog can only dismissed when the user taps **Cancel**.

<a href="" id="constraints---none"></a>**Constraints:** None  
This customization supports: **per-IMSI** value

<a href="" id="instructions-"></a>**Instructions:**  
1.  Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample.

    ``` syntax
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"  
                         Name="AutoDismissUssdWaitingDialog"  
                         Description="Use to dismiss the last 'Waiting...' dialog in cases where there is a sequence of USSD or SIM app dialogs"."  
                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 

      
      <!-- Define the Targets --> 
      <Targets>
         <Target Id="">
            <TargetState>
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
            </TargetState>
         </Target>
      </Targets>
      
      <Static>
        <Settings Path="Multivariant">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="1" />
        </Settings>
        <Settings Path="AutoDataConfig">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="0" />
        </Settings>
      </Static>

      <!-- Specify the Variant -->
      <Variant Name=""> 
        <TargetRefs>
          <TargetRef Id="" /> 
        </TargetRefs>

        <Settings Path="Phone/PerSimSettings/$(__IMSI)"> 
          <Setting Name="AutoDismissUssdWaitingDialog" Value="" />        
        </Settings>  

      </Variant>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

2.  Specify an `Owner`.

3.  For the **per-IMSI** case:

    1.  Define **Targets** or conditions for when a variant can be applied, such as keying off a SIM's MCC, MNC, and SPN.

    2.  Define settings for a **Variant**, which are applied if the associated target's conditions are met.

4.  Set `AutoDismissUssdWaitingDialog` to one of the following values:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>0 or 'False'</p></td>
    <td><p>The last <strong>Waiting…</strong> dialog won't be dismissed until the user cancels to dismiss the dialog. This may be confusing in some cases and can make the dialog appear frozen.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>1 or 'True'</p></td>
    <td><p>The last <strong>Waiting…</strong> dialog will be automatically dismissed when the sequence of USSD or SIM app dialogs completes.</p>
    <p>This is the default OS behavior.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
