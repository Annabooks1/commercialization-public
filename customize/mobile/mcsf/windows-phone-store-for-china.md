# Windows Store for China


For a Windows 10 Mobile device shipping in China, OEMs must specify that the device is intended for that market by setting the **PhoneROMLanguage** setting in **DeviceTargetingInfo** to the appropriate locale ID. For example, for Chinese (China) the locale ID must be set to 0804. When enabled, users are routed to the Windows Store for China.

**Note**  
This customization is only a requirement for China.

          <TargetRef Id="" /> 
        </TargetRefs>

       </Settings> 
      </Variant>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

2.  Specify an `Owner`.

3.  Set `PhoneROMLanguage` to 0804 for China (Chinese).

    If partners do not set the `PhoneROMLanguage` setting to a China locale ID, partners may not ship the device in China. For more information about all locale IDs (LCIDs) including Chinese LCIDs, see [Locale IDs assigned by Microsoft](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=269594) on MSDN.

<a href="" id="testing-"></a>**Testing:**  
1.  Flash the build containing this customization to a device with a UICC.

2.  From the device, launch the Windows Store and verify that you are routed to the store for China.
