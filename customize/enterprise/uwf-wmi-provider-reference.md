To help protect physical storage media, you can use the WMI providers for Unified Write Filter (UWF) to configure UWF.

This section describes the WMI provider classes for UWF.

<a href="" id="uwf-excludedregistrykey"></a>[UWF\_ExcludedRegistryKey](uwf-excludedregistrykey.md)

**Note**  
We recommend setting the authentication level to PacketIntegrity or PacketPrivacy for remote clients when you connect to WMI providers under root\\standardcimv2\\embedded when using WMI scripts or applications. For more information about how to use authentication with WMI providers, see this [WMI Enhancements in Windows PowerShell 2.0 CTP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=267505) on TechNet.
