# DISM How-to Topics (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)


This section provides information about servicing an existing Windows image using the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. You can add or remove language packs or drivers, and you can update an existing offline or online image when new software and hardware become available. Offline servicing is updating an image that has been mounted or applied, but is not currently installed and running. Online servicing is updating the image on a running installation of the Windows operating system. You can use DISM to mount a Windows image (.wim) file or a virtual hard disk (VHD) for servicing.
