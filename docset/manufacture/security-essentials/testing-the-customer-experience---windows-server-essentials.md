# Testing the Customer Experience - Windows Server Essentials


To verify the customer experience and check your customizations, run through the Initial Configuration on a target computer.

**Important**  
You must run the Sysprep.exe command to prepare the image for deployment before you test the Initial Configuration experience. For more information, see [Preparing the Image for Deployment - Windows Server Essentials](preparing-the-image-for-deployment---windows-server-essentials.md).

A network connection is required to test the Initial Configuration. By default, DHCP is not configured or installed on the server.

 

**To test the customer experience**

-   Complete the Initial Configuration at least one time manually to walk through the customer experience.

-   If you cobranded the Dashboard you must complete the Initial Configuration to verify the branding.

-   If you cobranded the Remote Web Access site, you must access http://&lt;servername&gt; to verify the branding (&lt;servername&gt; is the name of the server).

-   To verify the partner Support Information, in the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to the Help button.
