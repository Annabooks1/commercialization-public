# Add Top-Level Categories to the Launchpad (Macintosh Operating System)


To add top-level categories to the Launchpad on a computer running the Macintosh operating system, create a Launchpad add-in that adds top-level categories, using a combination of information from the [Windows Deployment Tools Technical Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=214548) and from the topic titled “How-to: Add Tasks and Categories to the Launchpad" in the [Windows Server Solutions SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=248648).
