# Determine if MMOS is running


You can check to see if MMOS is running the same way that you check when running in Manufacturing Mode. For more info, see [Detect Manufacturing Mode](how-to-detect-manufacturing-mode.md).

**Note**  You should not query the ManufacturingOS registry setting as this key is obsolete.
