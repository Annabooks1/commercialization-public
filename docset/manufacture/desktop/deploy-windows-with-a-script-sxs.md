# Lab 1b: Deploy Windows using a script

You can use scripts to take a Windows image and deploy Windows onto new PCs quickly. You can modify these scripts to change the size of the drive partitions or combine them with other steps to add apps and features. 

**Step 1: Copy the base Windows image file to the Storage USB drive**

1.  From your technician PC, copy the main Windows image file to your USB storage drive:
    ``` syntax
    copy D:\sources\install.wim file E:\images\install.wim.
	```
	where D: is the drive from the Windows ISO and E: is the USB storage drive. 

2.  Copy the [sample scripts](windows-deployment-sample-scripts-sxs.md) to the root of the USB storage drive.

**Step 2: Apply the Windows images using a script**

Use deployment scripts to apply the image onto a test device. These scripts set up the hard drive partitions and add the files from the Windows image to the partitions.

    You can use the [sample scripts](windows-deployment-sample-scripts-sxs.md) for different device firmware types (the newer UEFI-based BIOS, or the legacy BIOS). Some UEFI-based devices include support for the older legacy BIOS. For more info, see [UEFI Firmware](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526945).

    ![Image shows that to create a reference computer with customizations, you need a new PC, an image file, and a deployment script.](images/dep-win8-sxs-createdeploymentscript.jpg)

1.  [Boot the reference device to Windows PE using the Windows PE USB key](install-windows-pe-sxs.md).

2.  Take out the Windows PE USB key and put in the Storage USB key.
	
3.  Find the drive letters of the USB key by using diskpart:

    ``` syntax
    diskpart
    DISKPART> list volume
    DISKPART> exit
    ```

    For example, the drives can be lettered like this: C = Windows; D = USB storage drive.

4.  Format the primary hard drive, create the partitions, and apply the image by using the pre-made [sample scripts](windows-deployment-sample-scripts-sxs.md). The script **ApplyImage.bat** relies on the diskpart scripts: CreatePartitions-UEFI.txt and CreatePartitions-BIOS.txt, which must be placed in the same folder.

    ``` syntax
    D:
    D:\ApplyImage.bat D:\Images\install.wim
    ```

    When prompted by the script: 
    
    1.  Press Y to format the drive.
    2.  Press Y to select Compact OS, or N to select a non-compacted OS:
        -   **Y**: Applies the image using Compact OS. This is best for devices with solid-state drives and drives with limited free space. Use this for hardware configuration 1 and 2.
        -   **N**: Applies the image as a fully-uncompressed image. This is best for high-performance devices or devices that use traditional hard drives with rotational media. Use this for hardware configuration 3.
    3.  Press N to indicate the image does not include extended attributes (EA).

    The scripts apply the image to the drive, and then finishes.

	
**Step 3: Apply siloed provisioning packages (SPPs) and the recovery image.**

For your initial tests, skip these steps. 
For final deployments, you'll need to add the recovery image before deploying the PCs in case something goes wrong.

1.  Skip this step until you've completed [Lab 1f: Add Windows classic apps with siloed provisioning packages (SPP)](add-classic-apps-wth-spps-sxs.md). This step adds classic Windows applications to your images. This must be done before adding the recovery image.
    ```syntax
    DISM.exe /ImagePath:C:\ /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:e:\repository\office16_base.spp /PackagePath:e:\repository\office16_fr-fr.spp /PackagePath:e:\repository\office16_de-de.spp
	```

2. 	Apply the recovery image. The script **ApplyRecovery.bat** relies on the diskpart scripts: HidePartitions-UEFI.txt and HidePartitions-BIOS.txt, which must be placed in the same folder.

	```syntax
	D:\ApplyRecovery.bat
	```

3. Exit. (`exit`)
	
**Step 6: Verify apps**
1.  After the PC boots, either create a new user account, or else press Shift+F3 to reboot into the built-in administrator account (This is also known as audit mode).
2.  See if your apps and add-ons are installed.
	
**Step 3: Restart the device**

For these first test images, we're not going to apply the recovery image. Just disconnect the USB flash drive and the external USB hard drive and type `exit`.

The PC should reboot into Windows. While youâ€™re waiting for the preparation phase to complete, go back to your technician PC and continue with the lab.

**Troubleshooting**: If the device does not boot, turn on the device, and press the key that opens the boot-device selection menu (for example, the **Esc** key). Select the hard drive as your boot device, and continue.

To learn more about SPPs, see [Siloed provisioning packages (SPPs)](siloed-provisioning-packages.md).
