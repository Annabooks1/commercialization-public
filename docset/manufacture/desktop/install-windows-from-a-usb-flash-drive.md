2.  Open **Disk Management**: **Start** &gt; Settings: **Create and format hard disk partitions**.

3.  Format the partition: Right-click the USB drive partition &gt; **Format**. Select the **FAT32** file system to be able to boot either BIOS-based or UEFI-based PCs.

4.  Set the partition as active: Right-click the USB drive partition &gt; **Mark Partition as Active**.

**Copy Windows Setup to the USB flash drive**

1.  Copy and paste the entire contents of the Windows product DVD to the USB flash drive.

2.  Optional: add an Unattend file or a configuration set to automate the installation process. For more information, see Automate Windows Setup.

**Install Windows to the new PC**
