# Configure Oobe.xml


Oobe.xml is a content file used to collect text and images for customizing Windows® OOBE. To build a single Windows image that contains multiple languages to deliver to more than one country or region, you can add multiple Oobe.xml files to customize the content based on the language and country/region selections of the customer.
