# OEM Windows Desktop Deployment and Imaging Lab

Getting ready to build and test WindowsÂ 10 desktop PCs? This lab provides strategies for creating base images and updating them with command-line tools. The commands can be scripted, helping you quickly customize new images for specific markets to meet your customers' needs.

New in this lab: With siloed provisioning packages, you can now capture and apply Windows desktop applications during deployment, one at a time. This avoids some of the time-consuming steps involved in generalizing and recapturing images.

Let's get started!
