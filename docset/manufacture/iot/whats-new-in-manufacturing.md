**May 18, 2016:** 
*  Added new tools: NewAppPkg, NewDriverPkg, NewCommonPkg, Inf2Cab, BuildPkg

*  Updated: BuildAllPkgs. When building packages, you'll get a cleaner display just showing the packages that have been processed, and any errors. To troubleshoot, you can now see the full log files at \Build\<arch>\pkgs\logs.
