# Windows ADK IoT Core Add-ons: contents

The [Windows 10 IoT Core ADK Add-Ons](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=735028) include OEM-specific tools to create images for your IoT Core devices with your apps, board support packages (BSPs), settings, drivers, and features.

The [IoT Core manufacturing guides](iot-core-manufacturing-guide.md) walks you through building images with these tools.

## <span id="Root_folder"></span>Root folder

-   **IoTCoreShell**: Launches the [IoT Core Shell command-line](iot-core-adk-addons-command-line-options.md#iotcoreshell.cmd).

-   **README.md**: Version info, links to documentation

## <span id="Build"></span><span id="build"></span><span id="BUILD"></span>Build
This is the output directory where the build contents are stored. It starts as empty.

## <span id="Common_files"></span><span id="common_files"></span><span id="COMMON_FILES"></span>Common files

Source files for packages that are common to all architectures.

-   **Custom.Cmd**: Package to include the oemcustomization cmd. This is product-specific and picks up the input file from product directory. This also makes an registry entry with the product name.

-   **Device.SystemInformation**: Package to add the System product name and manufacturer name to the image.

-   **DeviceLayout.GPT4GB**: Package with GPT [drive/partition layout](device-layout.md) for UEFI-based devices with 4GB drives.

-   **DeviceLayout.GPT2GB**: Package with GPT [drive/partition layout](device-layout.md) for UEFI-based devices with 2GB drives.

-   **DeviceLayout.MBR4GB**: Package with MBR [drive/partition layout](device-layout.md) for legacy BIOS-based devices with 4GB drives.

-   **DeviceLayout.MBR2GB**: Package with MBR [drive/partition layout](device-layout.md) for legacy BIOS-based devices with 2GB drives.

-   **ImageSettings.CrashSettings**: Package with settings for system crashes. Replaces the previous package: Registry.CrashSettings.

-   **ImageSettings.VideoMode**: Package with settings for headed or headless video mode.

-   **OemTools.InstallTools**: Package that automatically installs OEM apps found in the C:\OEMApps folder.

-   **Provisioning.Auto**: Package used to [add a provisioning package to an image](add-a-provisioning-package-to-an-image.md). This is product specific and picks up the input ppkg file from the product directory.

-   **Provisioning.Manual**: Package for manual provisioning. This depends on Custom.Cmd for triggering the provisioning.

-   **Registry.Version**: Package containing registry settings with product and version information.

-   **Settings.HotKey**: Sample package to demonstrate how to [add a registry setting to an image](add-a-registry-setting-to-an-image.md). This setting changes the values of the left Windows key, right Windows key, and the Alt+Right Windows key to act as the Home key.

-   **OEMCommonFM.xml**: Feature manifest for OEM Common packages.
