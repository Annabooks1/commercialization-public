# Windows ADK silent install

If you have a scenario where you need to silently install the Windows ADK, you can install using the command line.

Make sure that your PC remains connected to the Internet while ADK Setup is running. ADK Setup downloads installation packages from the Internet while it runs. 

## Install the Windows ADK by using the command line
1. Download adksetup.exe from this [Microsoft website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit) to your PC.
2. Open a Command Prompt as administrator.
3. In the Command Prompt window, change to the directory that contains adksetup.exe.

        
```
    cd %userprofile%\downloads
```

4. Install the ADK. Use /quiet for silent installation. Use /features to specify features. For example, install Deployment Tools and Windows PE silently:


```
    adksetup.exe /quiet /features OptionId.DeploymentTools OptionId.WindowsPreinstallationEnvironment
```
