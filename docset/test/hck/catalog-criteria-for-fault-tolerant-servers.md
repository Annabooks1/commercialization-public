## About This Download


This download document provides the authoritative source for information about requirements for server systems that run the Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition or Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition operating system and that qualify for the "Fault Tolerant" designation on the Windows Windows Server Catalog published by Microsoft Corporation.

The January 2005 revision incorporates the "Designed for Windows" logo requirements for x64-based systems. The October 2006 revision only updates the name of the Windows Server Catalog.
