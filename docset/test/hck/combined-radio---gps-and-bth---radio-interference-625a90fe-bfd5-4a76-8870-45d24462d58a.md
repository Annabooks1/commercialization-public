# Combined Radio - GPS and BTH - Radio Interference


This automated test verifies that systems that support both GPS and Bluetooth radio hardware can operate both radios simultaneously without excessive interference.

This test performs the following operations:

-   Subscribes to GPS data events

-   Performs Bluetooth scanning and pairing

-   Unsubscribes from GPS data events

The GPS data events should continue to be generated while the Bluetooth radio performs scanning and pairing.
