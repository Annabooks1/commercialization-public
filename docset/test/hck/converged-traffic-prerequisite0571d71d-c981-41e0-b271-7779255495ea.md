# Converged Traffic Prerequisite


This test sets a particular machine as the primary target for the Converged Traffic Test. The Converged Traffic Test multi-machine job will sit in the pipeline, unable to be scheduled, until after this task has been run.

This task should be run against the primary test machine that is used for other certification tests (i.e., the machine with the device under test). If this task is run against the wrong machine or run against both the primary and secondary machines, then the Converged Traffic Test may fail because the roles of the two machines may be reversed.
