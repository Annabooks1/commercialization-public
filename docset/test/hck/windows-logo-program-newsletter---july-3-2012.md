## <a href="" id="logoart"></a>Logo artwork usage guidelines update for Windows 8


The following guidelines apply to use of the certification logos for Windows 8:

-   **On product packaging**, you can use the logo only if the product is shipped by the manufacturer after July 31, 2012. If the product ships earlier than that, you can use text treatment to showcase certification.

-   **In other content such as print or online materials**, you may not publicly display the logo before September 1, 2012. For materials that you publicly display earlier than that, you can use text treatment to showcase certification.

## <a href="" id="signatures"></a>Windows 2000 Digital Signatures No Longer Available after July 31, 2012


Windows 2000 digital signatures will no longer be available after July 31, 2012. This feature will be removed and partners will no longer be able to obtain a Windows 2000 digital signature. If your company has any concerns related to removing this feature, please address those concerns to logofb@microsoft.com.

## <a href="" id="webcams"></a>System Requirement Clarification: Indicator Required on Built-in Webcams


An important new requirement for the Windows 8 experience is Device.Streaming.Webcam.Base.UsageIndicator. Because Windows 8 is a multitasking environment, a Metro style app could be using the webcam in the background. It is critical to the user that there is some indication that the camera is on. This is a clearly defined device requirement, but we have found that some system designers are not aware of the requirement because it is not spelled out in the system requirements.

Systems are required to use certified component devices, so component requirements typically are not repeated in the system requirement. However, because the indicator may be physically separated from the camera, the indicator requirement might easily be overlooked. Please be sure your system designs include the indicator.

## <a href="" id="discount"></a>Special Discount for Early Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 Submissions


The Windows Hardware Certification Program is now open for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 submissions. Take advantage of the early-bird submission prices. All Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 submissions are only $100 (US) until General Availability of these operating systems.

## <a href="" id="appcertkit"></a>Windows Application Certification Kit Is Required for All Client Software Submissions


The Windows Software Certification Program would like to remind our partners that software submissions to the Dashboard Services website must now use Windows Application Certification Kit (Windows ACK). Partners will no longer be able to use Windows Software Logo Kit (Windows SLK).
