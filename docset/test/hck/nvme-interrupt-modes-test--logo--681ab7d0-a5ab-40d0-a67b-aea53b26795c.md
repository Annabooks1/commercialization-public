## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Hard Disk Drive Testing Prerequisites](hard-disk-drive-testing-prerequisites.md).

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Storage Testing](troubleshooting-devicestorage-testing.md).

If the test fails to find the drive letter of the device, try to restart the machine with device attached, format and mount NTFS volume and assign drive letter, reboot machine to confirm drive letter and drive number of device are recognizable in diskmgmt.msc and then schedule the test.
