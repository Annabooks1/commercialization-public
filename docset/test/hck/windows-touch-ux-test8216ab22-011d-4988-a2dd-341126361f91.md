# Windows Touch Ux Test


This test validates the Windows Touch user experience that is associated with the hardware requirements. Tests are designed to run freehand.

## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Windows Touch Testing Prerequisites](windows-touch-testing-prerequisites.md).

The Windows Touch UX Test suite combines disparate touch requirements into everyday tasks. The principle benefit of this test suite is to test the requirements together and to verify that a user can reliably complete the core Windows touch interactions.

### Tile Tap

Tile Tap is a simple accuracy test in the context of tapping tiles on the **Search** screen. It appears four times: one time in each screen quadrant. To complete the test, tap each blue box as it appears.

In the [Windows Touch Device Certification Processes and Windows Touch Test Lab (WTTL) Service](windows-touch-device-certification-processes-and-windows-touch-test-lab--wttl--service.md), a natural tapping motion is used; we recommend that you also use a natural tapping motion during your internal testing. Figure 1. Precise Tapping Position, shows an unnatural tapping position. Figure 2. Natural Tapping Position, shows a more natural tapping position.

### Semantic Zoom

Semantic zoom is an active feature in many of the default controls in the [Windows 8 SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=263483). For example, you can see Semantic Zoom on the **Start** screen, where the user can pinch and zoom to reveal different views of the application tiles.

In each iteration of the test, you are asked to zoom in or zoom out. You can accomplish these, respectively, by pulling your fingers apart or by pulling them together. There are two versions of this test: one that uses two fingers and one that uses five fingers.

### Quick Toss

Quick toss is a punctuated panning motion that scrolls quickly through pages of content.

The Quick Toss test goes through a series of iterations. In each iteration, you quickly swipe up or down the screen by using one or two fingers. (Note that speed is enforced in this test.) A quick toss that is performed too slowly will not cause a failure, but it will require you to repeat that iteration.

**Note**  
When inertia is applied and the tester cannot pan the color screen accordingly (that is, a faster swipe does not make color screen scrolls faster), this test should be treated as a valid fail because the user cannot pan smoothly by using the desired velocity.

 

### Keyboard

The Keyboard test simulates quick typing on the touch keyboard. It presents four keys that must all be tapped once within one second. (This represents a typing speed of four keys per second, or roughly 48 words per minute.)

The test times out one second after the first target is pressed. If a target is missed because of a dropped touch or a sequence of taps that are interpreted as a move, the test can appear to be lagging.

Figure 3 Recommended Finger Position, shows you how to place your fingers on the touch screen for this test.

### Hyperlink

The Hyperlink test asks you to tap a series of hyperlinks that are rendered at their typical size. The test is complete after all of the hyperlinks have been tapped or missed.

### Press and Hold

*Press and hold* is a gesture that users can employ to discover more information about a UI element. For example, if you hold a finger down on the desktop, the context menu opens.

The Press and Hold test presents four squares: three gray and one blue. You must press the blue square until it turns green. Repeat until the test is complete.

### Mobar

The modern taskbar (mobar) is the dividing line between two active displayed Windows store applications. The user can drag this line to change the area that is allocated to either application, or to remove one application from the screen.

The Mobar test draws a blue line and asks you to drag from any location on this line to a green box. The locations of the blue line and the green box change during the test, but the goal is always the same.

### Backstack

The *Backstack* test models the back and forward navigation functionality that is built into the tailored app version of Internet Explorer® 10, whereby the user can pan left or right to reveal recently visited pages.

In each iteration of the test, you must swipe left or right. You must complete each iteration to end the test.

### Edgy

The *Edgy* test models the edge gestures that perform such actions as to display the **Charms Bar** or to cycle through and dismiss applications.

To complete the test, swipe from the border area (or bezel) onto the visible screen area through the side of the screen that is colored blue.

**Note**  
each swipe requires a minimum speed of 20mms. This is the same speed threshold that is used in the operating system. If the tester does not achieve this speed, an “Unknown Reason” error will display.

 

### Select

*Select* is a short swipe gesture that brings focus to an item in the tailored app list views. On the **Start** screen, users can select their application tiles to reveal options such as **Pin to Start** or **Run as Administrator**. The **File Picker** uses this gesture to let the user select multiple files.

The Select test presents a number of tiles, one of which is colored blue. The goal is to pull up or down on the blue tile toward the gray line without passing it. The test monitors for motion that is perpendicular to the direction of the select gesture; the user sees this motion as panning.

### Rearrange

*Rearrange* is a gesture that is used to move application tiles on the screen. You accomplish this by pulling on an application tile until it breaks free.
