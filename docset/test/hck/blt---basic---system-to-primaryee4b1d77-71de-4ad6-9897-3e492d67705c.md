# Blt - Basic - System to Primary


This automated test performs a simple DirectDraw blt from a system memory surface to the primary surface.

The test compares the resulting image against its own simulation. The test expects the DirectDraw blt and the simulation to match exactly.

This test runs in all reported display modes. Because all blts are performed directly to the primary surface, you can visually inspect the results. Use the Pause key to give yourself more time.

DirectDraw can perform this blt operation in its emulation layer if the driver does not support it. Driver support is indicated by means of the DDCAPS\_CANBLTSYSMEM flag and the various dwSVB fields of the DDNTCORECAPS structure.

**Warning**  
Support for system-to-video blts is not required. If the driver does not report the appropriate caps, the Display Compatibility Test (DCT) will not run this test.

 

This topic applies to the following test jobs:

## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Graphic Adapter or Chipset Testing Prerequisites](graphic-adapter-or-chipset-testing-prerequisites.md).

In addition, this test requires the following software and hardware.

-   DirectX® version 7.0 or later

-   Display adapter with DDraw capabilities

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Graphics Testing](troubleshooting-devicegraphics-testing.md).

Turn off the screen saver and disable the power management before you run this test. Mode changes and full-screen applications can cause failures, so you should avoid them.

## More information


Most of the Microsoft® DirectDraw tests (including the Automatic Stereo test) are located in Fnddraw.exe. You can run Fnddraw.exe outside of the Display Compatibility Test (DCT) shell, and select individual tests. On the **Tests** menu, click **Select Tests**.

The test titles that are listed in the DCT shell do not directly match the test names in Fnddraw.exe. In fact, the names in the DCT often refer to a group of Fnddraw tests. You can obtain the Fnddraw test case names from the DCT log file.

You can pause many Fnddraw tests (especially blt-related tests) to give you time to analyze the blt results. Use the Pause key to pause and resume.

Use the Esc key to stop a test run. Be aware that some tests are more responsive than others.
