# Device.Streaming Testing


This section describes how to test streaming media devices and certify them for use on Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) and set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

The Device.Streaming testing category includes digital video recorders and digital media servers. If your device includes additional functionality, you must complete additional tests.

This section includes the following topics.
