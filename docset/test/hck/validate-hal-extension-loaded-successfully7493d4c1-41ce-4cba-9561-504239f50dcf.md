## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](wdtf-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md).

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting System Fundamentals Testing](troubleshooting-system-fundamentals-testing.md).

You can try the following if the test fails:

-   Ensure that the HAL extension is digitally signed correctly. The HAL extension requires a special EKU signing certificate.

-   Ensure that the CSRT table has a valid resource descriptor for the HAL extension.

-   Ensure that the following registry location has a valid HAL extension entry: **HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\OSExtensionDatabase**

-   Check the log file for more information on why the HAL extension could not be loaded.
