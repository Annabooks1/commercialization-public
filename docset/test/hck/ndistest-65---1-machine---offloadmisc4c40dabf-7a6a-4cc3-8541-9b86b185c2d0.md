# NDISTest 6.5 - 1 Machine - OffloadMisc


This test validates the ability of the miniport driver to persist the offload setting changes through unload and reload of the driver. The test queries the hardware offload capability and current offload capability, and then constructs a NDIS\_OFFLOAD\_PARAMETERS structure to flip the current offload capability. The driver is then unloaded and loaded again. The miniport driver's current offload capability must not change before and after the unload and load operation. At last, the current offload operation is restored through another OID\_TCP\_OFFLOAD\_PARAMETERS. The driver is unloaded and loaded again and configuration persistence is also tested during the restoration operation.
