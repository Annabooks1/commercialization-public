# HCK API Overview


You can use the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) API for Windows 8 to automate any parts of the certification test process. The API exposes all functionality of Windows HCK Studio, so you can use both Windows HCK Studio and automation in your certification test workflow.

The Windows HCK API supports any Microsoft® .NET Framework 4.0 (and later) programming language (for example, C# and Windows PowerShell®). This document provides a detailed description of the Windows HCK API.

**Note**  
HCK Studio uses the HCK APIs described in this document. You cannot run scripts or applications that access the HCK APIs and simultaneously interact with HCK Studio. Before interacting with HCK Studio, make sure your scripts and/or applications are no longer running.
