# Device.Portable Testing


This section describes how to test features in the Device.Portable category and certify them for use with Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), and then set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure the Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

**Note**  
To run the Digital Still Camera tests, you must first manually select the Device.Portable node and then right-click the node and select **Device.Portable.DigitalCamera** as the test category. This will properly populate the test that is required for Digital Still Camera testing.
