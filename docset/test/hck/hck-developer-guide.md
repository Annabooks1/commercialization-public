# HCK Developer Guide


The Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) is based on Windows Test Technologies. Partners that want to certify that their computers or devices support Windows can use the Windows HCK to test their products. Products that pass certification can participate in the Windows Certification Program. For partners that want to automate the testing process, Microsoft provides an API that can automate the testing process.
