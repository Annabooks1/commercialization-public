# Registry Validation


This automated test verifies that display drivers create the correct registry entries.

This test validates the registry entries that a video card driver makes to ensure that they are complete and sensible. Correct entries in the registry are important for the performance and stability of the Microsoft Windows graphics stack.

During installation, video card drivers must create registry entries. The Graphics-0034 assertion lists the registry entries that this test verifies. The test verifies that the registry entries exist and that they contain information of the correct type.

Additionally, string registry entries must contain at least one character and must not contain the word "Microsoft."

Finally, the file version that is set on the display driver DLL file must conform to the standards that are described in the test assertions.
