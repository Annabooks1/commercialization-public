# WCN UPnP Verify the router is able to display the WPS Pin (Manual Test)


This test verifies the router is able to display the WPS PIN. The router should have a way to display the WPS PIN. If the WPS PIN is static, it should be printed on the router and should be exactly 8 numeric characters. If the WPS PIN is dynamic, then the router should have a way to display the current WPS PIN on the router (for example, using an LCD display). A dynamic WPS PIN can be 4 or 8 numeric characters. The test will pass if the router meets the specified criteria and fail if it does not.
