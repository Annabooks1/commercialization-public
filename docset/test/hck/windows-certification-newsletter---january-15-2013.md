## <a href="" id="posttime"></a>UEFI POST TIME requirement relaxed for some all-in-one systems


Based on industry feedback, we're relaxing the UEFI POST TIME requirement to enable large storage capacity in all-in-one systems.

Conditions:

-   PCs must be an all-in-one system with integrated displays.

-   Systems that have 3 TB or greater capacity must POST in 10 seconds or less.

-   Systems shipping after Jan 1, 2014, must meet the requirements published on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/).

This delayed enforcement erratum begins April 15, 2013, when the [UEFI requirement Erratum 478 relaxation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/jj679343.aspx) expires, and ends in October 2014.

To take advantage of this new delayed enforcement, Include ID 1250 in your README file starting April 15, 2013.

## <a href="" id="wttl"></a>Windows Touch Test Lab closed for Chinese New Year


We'd like to remind our partners that [Windows Touch Test Lab](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh872970) will be closed from February 9–17 for Chinese New Year. There will be no device delivery or submission processing during those 9 days.

Partners who want to ensure device certification prior to the holiday should:

-   Email the lab at tab-ext@microsoft.com with submission ID and stack-up details.

-   Submit physical hardware to the lab no later than January 31, 2013.

Submissions made or devices delivered after January 31 might not be processed before the holiday. We also expect submission volume to be heavy, so plan for a 5–10 business day turnaround, in addition to the holiday break.

## <a href="" id="review"></a>UEFI submission review processes changed


UEFI submissions will no longer go through an automated signing process. Instead, we'll review them manually twice a week. You can expect your submission to be processed in about 5 business days. To avoid delays, please follow the guidelines posted on the [UEFI submission page](https://sysdev.microsoft.com/Hardware/member/SubmissionWizard/CreateUefiSubmission.aspx) on the [Hardware Dashboard](https://sysdev.microsoft.com/hardware/member/). Remember when submitting to the [UEFI signing portal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh973604) to:

-   Provide descriptive info when submitting content.

-   Submit only product-quality code.

-   Ensure that your code doesn't execute untrusted code.

## <a href="" id="forum"></a>Please join us in our online forum


We'd like to invite you to the brand new [Windows Hardware Testing and Certification forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/whck/threads) on MSDN.

The forum is a place for engineers testing and certifying Windows hardware, drivers, and systems to share knowledge, get questions answered, and learn from shared experiences. To begin leveraging the collective knowledge of the community, just post a question on your topic of interest.

The forums are public, so please don't post questions or comments about prerelease versions of the Hardware Certification Kit. As with all other online discussions, be mindful of your privacy — never post info that can personally identify you, like your email address or company name.

We monitor the forum, so if you have any suggestions or feedback for us on the kit, tests, or certification process, please feel free to post that, too!
