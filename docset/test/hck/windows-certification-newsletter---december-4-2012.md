## <a href="" id="wlk"></a>WLK 1.6 errata extended


We have updated all active errata filters for the Windows Logo Kit (WLK) 1.6 test kit. All errata that were fixed in the kit were expired. All active errata that weren't fixed have been extended until December 1, 2015. (This extension date shouldn't be considered an indication of the kit's retirement date.)

**View all of the errata on the Hardware Dashboard:**<https://sysdev.microsoft.com/Hardware/ec/>

## <a href="" id="review"></a>UEFI submission review processes changed


UEFI submissions will no longer go through an automated signing process. Instead, we'll review them manually twice a week. You can expect your submission to be processed in about 5 business days. To avoid delays, please follow the guidelines posted on the [UEFI submission page](https://sysdev.microsoft.com/Hardware/member/SubmissionWizard/CreateUefiSubmission.aspx) on the [Hardware Dashboard](https://sysdev.microsoft.com/hardware/member/). Remember when submitting to the [UEFI signing portal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh973604) to:

-   Provide descriptive info when submitting content.

-   Submit only product-quality code.

-   Ensure that your code doesn't execute untrusted code.

## <a href="" id="whck"></a>Windows Hardware Certification policies updated


We've updated the document explaining the program policies and processes. The updates include changes to billing, as well as more detailed info on testing and certifying Windows RT connected devices, and updated details for multifunction device testing. For systems, we've added a description of specialized PCs and clarified details on testing rules if a docking station exists for a certified system.

For help with Windows Store apps, check the forum or contact CSS.

## <a href="" id="lilnk"></a>Linking your device to your app


Now that Windows 8 is hitting the marketplace, more partners are beginning to grasp the potential of the Windows Store apps that are connected to your device. Although the experience is simple and seamless for end users, the process to create this linkage requires attention to details. We're finding that metadata submissions are failing because of minor issues.

The white paper "Windows Store Device App Lifecycle" details the .xml files that are needed to make the linkage, how to test the app and .xml files, and how to submit packages properly.

For help with Windows Store apps, check the forum or contact CSS.

**Download the white paper:**<http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh833785>

## <a href="" id="hckrtm"></a>HCK 2.0 RTM release is now required for submissions


The Release Preview of the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) has been retired. All submissions to the Hardware Dashboard must now use the Release to Market (RTM) version of the Windows HCK. Windows Logo Kit (WLK) 1.6 can still be used for Windows® XP, Windows Vista, Windows® 7, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008 R2 submissions until 90 days' notice is given.

## <a href="" id="forum"></a>Please join us in our online forum


We'd like to invite you to the brand new [Windows Hardware Testing and Certification forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/whck/threads) on MSDN.

The forum is a place for engineers testing and certifying Windows hardware, drivers, and systems to share knowledge, get questions answered, and learn from shared experiences. To begin leveraging the collective knowledge of the community, just post a question on your topic of interest.

The forums are public, so please don't post questions or comments about prerelease versions of the Hardware Certification Kit. As with all other online discussions, be mindful of your privacy — never post info that can personally identify you, like your email address or company name.

We monitor the forum, so if you have any suggestions or feedback for us on the kit, tests, or certification process, please feel free to post that, too!
