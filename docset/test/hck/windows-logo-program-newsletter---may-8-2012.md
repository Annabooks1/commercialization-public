## <a href="" id="rc"></a>Windows 8 RC Coming Soon


Steve Sinofsky announced that Windows 8 Release Candidate (RC) will be released publically in early June. You can use the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) released at that time to create Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 submissions. You can also use HCK for Windows 7, Windows Sever 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP submissions. Certification or logo is available only for Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7; the other programs are for driver signature only.

As announced in the last newsletter, you can continue to use Windows Logo Kit (WLK) 1.6 for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows 7 submissions. You cannot combine test logs from HCK and WLK in one submission package.

## <a href="" id="bird"></a>Early Bird Special for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 Submissions


The Windows Certification Program ensures that every certified product has been tested to install readily and run reliably on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Getting your products certified is a critically important step in your participation in the successful launch of Windows 8.

To help our hardware partners achieve certification, the Windows Certification team is pleased to announce that for a limited time we are reducing the submission fee. Effective with the release of Windows 8 RP, the fee for every new submission for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 logos will be only $100, a $150 discount. Please note this offer will be for a limited time. We will announce the end date for this offer when Windows 8 RP is released. Stay tuned!

This is a great opportunity to lower your development costs by downloading the latest Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) and testing your system or device for submission during this limited timeframe. This offer is available to both device and system partners.

## <a href="" id="billing"></a>Billing Policy Update


New submission fees take effect when Windows 8 Release Candidate (RC) is released. The following table shows the new submission fee structure.

Fees must be paid in US funds by check or wire transfer. Submissions under $1500.00 (US) may use credit cards. Fees are assessed on a per-submission basis. Each submission's total fee is based on the number of operating system families that are included in the submission. Localized driver packages may be included with any submissions without any extra charge. The minimum fee per submission is $100.00 for a device or system submission. The maximum fee per submission is $1,000.00 for a device or system submission.
