# Device.Audio Testing


This section describes how to test audio devices and certify them for use on Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), and then set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure the Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

The Device.Audio testing category includes external audio devices that you can attach to a computer, HD audio controllers, or audio processing objects (APOs) that enhanced the audio hardware capabilities. Integrated audio devices are tested as part of a system certification.

For a development resource for Audio System Effect Audio Processing Objects testing, see the Microsoft® DirectX® Software Development Kit (SDK) available from the [DirectX Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228857).
