# Device.Input Testing


This section describes how to test input devices and certify them for use on Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), and then set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure the Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

The Device.Input testing category includes the following kinds of devices:

-   Digitizers

-   Fingerprint readers

-   Game controllers

-   Keyboards

-   Mice or other pointing devices (including a touch-enabled device)

-   Sensor devices

-   Smart card readers

This section includes the following topics.
