# System Transcode Faster Than Real Time on Battery (DC) Power Source ( Manual on mobile devices )


This manual test verifies that a mobile system is capable of transcoding video faster than real time on a battery (DC) power source.

## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [System Client Testing Prerequisites](system-client-testing-prerequisites.md).

If the mobile system is on AC power when you start the test, you'll need to switch the power source from AC to DC (battery).

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting System Client Testing](troubleshooting-system-client-testing.md).
