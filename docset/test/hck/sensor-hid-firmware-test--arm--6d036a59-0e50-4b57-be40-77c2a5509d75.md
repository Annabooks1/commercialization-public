# Sensor HID Firmware Test (ARM)


Any sensor device that uses the SensorsHIDClassDriver.dll driver included with Windows must be compliant with all recommendations in the [Sensors HID Annotation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br259128.aspx) document. In the course of executing the sensor, no ETW error events should be raised by the SensorsHIDClassDriver.dll.

## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Sensor Device Testing Prerequisites](sensor-device-testing-prerequisites.md).

If this test is being run against a GPS sensor device node, make sure that you are running the test in an environment in which you can receive a GPS signal.

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Input Testing](troubleshooting-deviceinput-testing.md).
