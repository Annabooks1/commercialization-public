# OXPS Content Library - Thumbnail Processing (MANUAL)


The XPS Content Library tool prints a set of XPS file content that is a representative subset of the XPS specification. It uses a static set of XPS files. An XPS print filter and/or device is expected to consume all the valid XPS test files successfully and fail gracefully (no crashes, no "hangs," no resource leaks, and so on) on the non-conformant XPS files. This job is similar to the standard XPS Content library job, but only focusing on functionality related to Thumbnail processing. The job will only show up in the submission if the user has specified they support Thumbnail processing as part of creating the submission.

For information about this manual test, see [XPS Content Library - Thumbnail Processing (MANUAL)](xps-content-library---thumbnail-processing--manual-de12b7d9-c708-4972-b76c-400420e1cb95.md).
