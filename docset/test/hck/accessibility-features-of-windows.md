# Accessibility Features of Windows


The Windows operating system has many built-in accessibility features that are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, are blind or have low vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features are installed during the installation of Windows. For more information about these features, see Help in Windows and the Microsoft Accessibility website.

## Free Step-by-Step Tutorials


Microsoft offers a series of step-by-step tutorials that provide detailed procedures for adjusting the accessibility options and settings on your computer. This information is presented in a side-by-side format so that you can learn how to use the mouse, the keyboard, or a combination of both.

To find step-by-step tutorials for Microsoft products, see the Microsoft Accessibility website.

## Assistive Technology Products for Windows


A wide variety of assistive technology products are available to make computers easier to use for people with disabilities. You can search a catalog of assistive technology products that run on Windows at the Microsoft Accessibility website.

If you use assistive technology, be sure to contact your assistive technology vendor before you upgrade your software or hardware to check for possible compatibility issues.
