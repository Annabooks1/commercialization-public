## <a href="" id="tvtuner"></a>Update on the TV Tuner and WMC Remote Control and Receiver Product Categories


The TV Tuner and Windows Media Center Remote Control and Receiver categories and tests are not included with Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) because we are retiring these programs. You can use HCK to obtain a Windows 8 signed driver for these devices by passing the applicable tests. For example, if the device connects via USB, then the USB tests would appear. The tests that appear depend on the features that are detected, but there are no Windows Media Center or TV tuner tests in HCK. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can use Windows 8 signed drivers as part of their pre-installation image.

Partners can still make submissions for the Windows 7 Logo Program in these categories, by using Windows Logo Kit version 1.6.

## <a href="" id="workshoprt"></a>Windows Certification Workshop for Connected Devices on Windows RT


We are excited to announce the next in a series of Windows Certification Workshops, to be held on June 26 – 29, 2012, at the Hyatt Regency Bellevue in Bellevue, Washington.

This event focuses on the programs, processes, and tests that you use to certify your connected devices for Windows RT. The workshop provides a hands-on experience working directly with Microsoft developers and testers, using Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) to certify your hardware. You are encouraged to bring the connected devices that you are planning to certify. The workshop is an opportunity to certify your products directly on Windows RT systems available at the workshop.

There is no registration fee for this event. However, the event has limited space availability. The online [Windows Certification Workshops registration portal](http://www.windowscertificationworkshop.com/) is open for your registration.

Please note:

-   Space for this event is limited. We will notify you by email whether your registration is confirmed or not.

-   There is a limit of two participants per company or per division.

-   You are responsible for your own lodging. The Hyatt Regency Bellevue is offering a preferred rate to event attendees.

-   On the registration portal, please use the code “certfest” to register for the event.

-   For any issues with the registration, please email wincertwork@microsoft.com.

## <a href="" id="logoart"></a>Logo Artwork Usage Guidelines


A new logo artwork package is now available for download on the [Windows Hardware Developer Dashboard](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1389888808&rver=6.1.6206.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Fsysdev.microsoft.com%2FWLID%2FSignIn.ashx%3FReturnURL%3D%252fen-US%252fhardware%252fmember%252f&lc=1033&id=281915&mkt=en-US&cbcxt=hardware) website. The new package contains artwork for both Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. This new artwork may not be used publicly until after Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 General Availability.
