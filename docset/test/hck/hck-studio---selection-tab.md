# HCK Studio - Selection Tab


![hck 2.1 studio selection tab](images/hck-winb-studio-selection-tab.png)

The Selection tab displays all features that a device implements. Before you can see any features, you must first select a machine pool (drop-down list in the upper left corner). You can also search for specific features using the combination search drop-down list and search field.

The specific testable device is called the *target*. A device may contain multiple targets, represented by one or more hardware IDs. You can filter what you want to test by:

-   **Show selected.** This option displays the targets that you’ve selected. This view allows you to see just the areas you're testing. You also can filter a machine pool by category by using the **category** list. You can search for specific targets/features by using the search box.

-   **Systems.** To test a complete client or server computer.

-   **Devices and printers.** To test an external device that's connected to a test computer. This device typically appears in **Start** &gt; **Devices and Printers** on the test computer. This usually represents a collection of devices found on the Device Manager tab.

-   **Device manager.** To test a component of a test computer or external device, for example, a network card. This is the most detailed view.

-   **Software devices.** To test filter drivers, firewalls, and antivirus software that's installed on the test computer.

    **Note**  
    Some software drivers are associated with a physical device. If you cannot find your driver under **Software Device**, use the search bar on **Device Manager** to find the device under which your software driver is associated.

     

On this tab, you can do the following task:

-   [Step 5: Select target to certify](step-5-select-target-to-certify.md)

-   [Select targets for distributed testing](select-targets-for-distributed-testing.md)

-   [Manually add features](manually-add-features.md)
