Digital signature check boxes for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 are now available in the new Windows HCK for Windows 8.1 RTM.

When you successfully complete testing for a server certification of Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2, use the [Windows Dev Center hardware dashboard](http://click.email.microsoftemail.com/?qs=b091d52af68139665ed60d01f585f2840ee62c6f0a1f7a879c10199732fa99972c229889b99fd8e2) to create a submission package for uploading - the same process that you've used in the past. And, if you're using a uniform driver that's properly decorated to include Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003, the dashboard has check boxes for free digital signatures for those operating systems. You can select the check boxes only if the driver being submitted was previously fully tested for certification with an earlier version of the HCK. If you select these check boxes, you must add a Readme file to the supplemental folder that includes the previous submission IDs for the Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 certification testing.

All submissions for which you select these check boxes will go to the manual review queue so that the previous certification for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 can be confirmed. If no Readme file is provided for the certification testing for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003, the submission will be canceled.
