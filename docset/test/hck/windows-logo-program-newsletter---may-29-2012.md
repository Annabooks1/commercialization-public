## <a href="" id="preview"></a>Windows 8 Release Preview Is Coming!


We are rapidly approaching a major milestone: Windows 8 Release Preview (RP) becomes available in early June. With this version of the operating system (OS) and the accompanying certification kits, you can begin to certify your products for Windows 8. This edition of the newsletter contains important information that you'll need to know to be ready.

## <a href="" id="disruption"></a>Service Disruption Alert: Dashboard Prepares for Windows 8 Submissions


As part of the build-up for Windows 8 RP described above, the Dashboard will be offline for 24 hours beginning at noon Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7) on Wednesday, May 30, 2012. The maintenance will prepare the site to accept Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) submissions in addition to the current Windows Logo Kit 1.6 submissions.

## <a href="" id="uploadfail"></a>File Upload to Dashboard Site May Fail with 32-Bit Internet Explorer


Partners using a 32-bit version of Internet Explorer (IE) cannot upload files larger than approximately 500 MB. Partners who want to upload files larger than 500 MB must use a 64-bit version of IE. This issue will be fixed soon.

## <a href="" id="license"></a>New Hardware and Software Logo License Agreements Are Now Available


The new Hardware Logo License Agreement (LLA) 2013 and Software Logo License Agreement (LLA) 1.6 are now available for review and signing on the [Windows Hardware Developer Dashboard](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1389889743&rver=6.1.6206.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Fsysdev.microsoft.com%2FWLID%2FSignIn.ashx%3FReturnURL%3D%252fen-US%252fhardware%252fmember%252f&lc=1033&id=281915&mkt=en-US&cbcxt=hardware) website. Both LLAs have been updated to include information about the Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 operating systems.

**Note**  
You must sign the new Hardware LLA 2013 in order to upload any hardware logo program submissions. Likewise, you must sign the new Software LLA version 1.6 in order to upload any software logo program submissions. The Dashboard site will block any attempted submissions unless you have signed the appropriate new LLA for the type of submission you are attempting.

 

## <a href="" id="art"></a>New Logo Artwork Package to Be Available on Windows 8 Release Preview Date


The new LLAs allow you to use the new Windows 8 logo on any products you test and certify following the new Windows 8 requirements test kits. A new logo artwork package will be available for download from the Dashboard site on the Windows 8 Release Preview date. The new artwork package contains artwork for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.
