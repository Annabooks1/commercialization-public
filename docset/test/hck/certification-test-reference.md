# Certification Test Reference


This section contains the descriptions of all certification tests organized into hardware categories. If you are familiar with the certification process, you can review the specific sections that map to your device. You can also connect your device to an HCK environment and allow the system to detect what features and tests are applicable to your device. You can then press **F1** on any detected test to learn more.

For your driver to pass testing and obtain a logo, you must use the latest version of the Windows® Driver Kit to compile the driver.

**Important**  
Microsoft will continue to update test content as needed. To ensure you have the latest test information, see the [online version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=255241) of this section on the Windows Dev Center
