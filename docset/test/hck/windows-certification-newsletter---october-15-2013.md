## <a href="" id="hck1011"></a>HCK for Windows 8.1 RTM required for submissions as of November 30th


We’d like to remind our partners that starting November 30, 2013, submissions to the Windows Dev Center hardware dashboard must use the RTM version of the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) for Windows 8.1. The HCK for Windows 8.1 Preview is being retired on that date.

[Download the HCK for Windows 8.1 here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733613)

## <a href="" id="please1011"></a>Please join us in our online forum


We'd like to invite you to the [Windows Hardware Testing and Certification forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/home?forum=whck) on MSDN.

The forum is a place for engineers who test and certify Windows hardware, drivers, and systems to share knowledge, get questions answered, and learn from shared experiences. To begin learning from the collective knowledge of the community, just post a question on your topic of interest.

The forums are public, so please don't post questions or comments about prerelease versions of the HCK. As with all other online discussions, be mindful of your privacy—never post info that can personally identify you, like your email address or company name.

We'll be monitoring the forum, so if you have any suggestions or feedback for us on the kit, tests, or certification process, please feel free to post that, too!
