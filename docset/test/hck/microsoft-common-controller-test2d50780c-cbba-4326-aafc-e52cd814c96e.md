## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Game Controller Testing Prerequisites](game-controller-testing-prerequisites.md).

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Input Testing](troubleshooting-deviceinput-testing.md).

## More information


This test was created to ensure that the common controller device responds as it should, through the XINPUT API. This test checks all of the capabilities of the device that you are testing. This test will determine what type of common controller device is attached and adjust its tests accordingly (for example, wheels are tested differently than arcade joysticks).

Follow the steps that the test harness specifies. This test is a completely manual test, with the graphical user interface (GUI) showing prompts and instructions about what action to perform. There is an XML file that is created with test results after each completed pass.
