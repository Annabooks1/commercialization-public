# Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) Testing


This section describes how to test Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) software and certify it for use on Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), and then set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure the Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).
