# Device.Storage Testing


This section describes how to test storage devices and certify them for use on Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) and set up your testing environment. For information about how to install and configure Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

The Device.Storage category includes these items:

-   Internal hard disks

-   Hardware-based RAID storage arrays

-   Optical disk drives

-   Removable storage devices

-   Storage adapters or controllers

This section includes:
