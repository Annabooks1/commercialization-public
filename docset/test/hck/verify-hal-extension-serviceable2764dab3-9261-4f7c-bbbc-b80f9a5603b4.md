# Verify HAL Extension serviceable


This test verifies whether a HAL extension that is serviceable will go through the CSRT resource group using a Vendor ID and Device ID to generate an expected PNPID (for example ACPI\\MSFT\_1124). It then goes through all of the devices found to see whether there is a PNPID match.

## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](wdtf-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md).

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting System Fundamentals Testing](troubleshooting-system-fundamentals-testing.md).

This test validates whether a HAL extension is serviceable by ensuring a valid PNP ID is assigned.

You can try the following if the test fails:

-   Ensure that the HAL extension loaded correctly.

-   Ensure that the HAL extension has a valid PNP ID.

-   Ensure that the HCL extension driver has a valid hardware ID.

-   Check the log file for more information on why the HAL extension is not serviceable.
