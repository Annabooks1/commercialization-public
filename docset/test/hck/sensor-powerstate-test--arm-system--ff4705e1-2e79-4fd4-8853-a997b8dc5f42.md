# Sensor PowerState Test (ARM System)


This test validates that sensors will enter and leave power states at the appropriate time.

This is a system-specific implementation of an existing test. For more information on this test, see [Sensor PowerState Test (ARM)](sensor-powerstate-test--arm--2c32ae1c-f54d-40fb-b2fe-0942fb9f5666.md).

## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [System Client Testing Prerequisites](system-client-testing-prerequisites.md).

If a GPS sensor exists in the system, make sure that you are running the tests in an environment in which you can receive a GPS signal.

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting System Client Testing](troubleshooting-system-client-testing.md).
