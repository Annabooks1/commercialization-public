## <a href="" id="what813"></a>What's new for USB


### <a href="" id="usb-3-0-hubs-"></a>USB 3.0 hubs

For WHCK testing, we recommend that you use a hub that’s certified by the USB-IF and by Microsoft. You can check whether hub silicon and/or retail hubs have passed the USB-IF compliance program on the [usb.org](http://www.usb.org/kcompliance/view/) web site. You should note the revision number that’s certified. Some of the certified hub silicon is available in the form of evaluation boards, which can be used in testing the HCK. You can check whether a hub is WHCK certified for Windows 8.1 on the [Windows Certified Products List](https://sysdev.microsoft.com/en-US/Hardware/LPL/). Retail hubs that have passed USB-IF and Windows certification will carry logos for both programs. USB 3.0 hubs are needed for system, controller, and USB device testing.

### SuperMUTTs

SuperMUTTs, which must now be attached to all USB host controllers for System Fundamentals and Device Fundamental testing, can now be sourced by 2 vendors:

-   [JJG Technologies](http://www.jjgtechnologies.com/supermutt.md)

-   [Pactron](http://pactronstore.com/products/supermutt.mdl)

And please be sure to update the firmware on your SuperMUTT with the latest MUTT version 1.9 package, available on the [Hardware Dev Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj590752).

**Note**  
Before applying the QFE, close all active DTM Studio sessions. Applying this QFE might affect in-progress submissions, so please complete any submissions before applying the QFE. After installing this QFE, you'll need to regenerate any affected submission that was generated before the QFE was installed.

 

## <a href="" id="early813"></a>Early Bird Special for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 submissions until GA


The Windows Certification Program ensures that every certified product has been tested to install readily and run reliably on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. This is a great opportunity for device and system partners to lower development costs by downloading the latest Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) and testing your system or device for submission during this limited timeframe.

To help our hardware partners achieve certification, the Windows Certification Program team is pleased to announce that for a limited time we’re reducing the submission fee.

Until GA, the fee for every new submission for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 certifications is only $100, a $150 discount.
