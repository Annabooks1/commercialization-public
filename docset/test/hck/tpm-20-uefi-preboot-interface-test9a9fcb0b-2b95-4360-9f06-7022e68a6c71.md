# TPM 2.0 UEFI Preboot Interface Test


This manual test uses the TrEE UEFI protocol to test interaction with the TPM. The test fails if the system is PCAT and has a TPM 2.0. This test uses UEFI protocols to verify that a TPM is present to test the RNG command in pre-boot, to locate and verify that the TPM2 table tests the Platform Reset Attack Mitigation and UEFI interface, and checks that PCR values do not change when devices are enumerated. It also tests for the TPM extend performance in a preOS environment.

## Running the test


Before you run the test, review the prerequisites in [TPM System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](tpm-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md).

This test requires secure boot debug policy to be installed on Windows RT devices and secure boot to be turned off on non-Windows RT devices.

This test has no additional test parameters.

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting the Windows HCK Environment](troubleshooting-the-windows-hck-environment.md).

This test returns Pass or Fail. To review test details, review the test log from Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) Studio. To provide more information for troubleshooting failures in this test, you can enable tracing of the TPM. Refer to the steps provided under the Troubleshooting section in [TCG TPM Integration Test (Manual)](tcg-tpm-integration-test--manual-ac56901f-0f66-4013-b156-fe4b036cce60.md). Investigations also need log files with name like ‘tpm\*.txt’ and console.txt from the ‘Documents’ folder
