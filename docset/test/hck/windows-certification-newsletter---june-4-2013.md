## <a href="" id="hckreq"></a>Windows Hardware Certification requirements for Windows 8.1 are now available


New Hardware Certification requirements for systems, servers, devices, and filter drivers are now available for the coming Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 update.

The preview of the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) will be made available on June 26, concurrent with the release of the public preview for Windows 8.1 (code-named “Windows Blue”) and Windows Server 2012 R2. You will be able to begin certifying your systems, servers, and devices at that time.

To make your review of the new document easier, notice the table of key changes. As with the Windows 8 requirements, the new document is organized by feature so that the related requirements that define the features are found together. You’ll find a *Product Type to Requirements to Test* mapping matrix to help you determine which requirements and tests define certification for a given product type.

The new requirements for the Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 update are now available [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh833793).

## <a href="" id="errata"></a>Errata expiration guidelines


We've updated all active errata filters for the [Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) 2.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/hh852359). All active errata that weren't fixed in the test kit are now extended until 9/30/2013. We'll reevaluate all active errata again about 3 months before the new expiration dates. We'll either retire errata or extend the expiration date again, depending on whether fixes are in place for the test issues. A few errata are set to expire between now and 9/30 by design for delayed enforcement reasons or because fixes were implemented into the next HCK release. Those errata won't be extended again.

You can [check the status of all errata](https://sysdev.microsoft.com/en-US/Hardware/ec/) anytime on the [Hardware Dashboard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/). To narrow down the list, use the filters to view only active, expired, or expiring within 30 days. You can also search by ID and title.

## <a href="" id="sitedown"></a>Windows Dashboard site down for servicing, June 13-15


On June 13, 2013, at 8:00 A.M. Pacific Daylight Savings Time (UTC-8), Windows Hardware Development Center Dashboard will go offline for a scheduled hardware update. The migration of services is expected to take two calendar days. We’re trying to return functionality as soon as possible, but services will return no sooner than June 15, 2013 at 8:00 A.M. Pacific Daylight Savings Time. During this period, all Dashboard services will be unavailable. You won’t be able to view or perform certification/logo submissions, make device metadata submissions, obtain VeriSign certificates, sign legal agreements, use bug management functionality, or use any other service currently provided through the Dashboard. Please adjust your plans to account for this planned interruption of Dashboard services.

Please contact sysdev@microsoft.com if you have any questions.

## <a href="" id="hwlogo"></a>New Hardware Logo License Agreement 2014 now available


The new Hardware Logo License Agreement (LLA) 2014 is now available. The new LLA has been updated to include information about the Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating systems.

**Note**  
You must sign the new LLA 2014 in order to upload any Hardware Certification Program submissions after Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview become available. The Dashboard site will block any attempted submissions after the Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview date unless you have signed the new LLA.

 

## <a href="" id="swlogo"></a>New Software Logo License Agreement version 1.7 now available


The new Software Logo License Agreement (LLA) version 1.7 is now available. The new LLA has been updated to include information about the Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating systems.

**Note**  
You must sign the new LLA 1.7 in order to upload any Software Certification Program submissions after Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview become available. The Dashboard site will block any attempted submissions after the Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview date unless you have signed the new LLA.

 

## <a href="" id="bird"></a>Early bird special for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 submissions


The Windows Certification Program ensures that every certified product has been tested to install readily and run reliably on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.

To help our hardware partners achieve certification, the Windows Certification team is pleased to announce that for a limited time we're reducing the submission fee. Effective with the release of Windows 8.1 Preview, the fee for every new submission for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 logos will be only $100, a $150 discount. Please note this offer will last for a limited time. We'll announce the end date for the offer when Windows 8.1 Preview is released. Stay tuned!

This is a great opportunity to lower your development costs by downloading the latest Windows HCK and testing your system or device for submission. This offer is available to both device and system partners.
