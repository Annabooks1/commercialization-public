## <a href="" id="preview"></a>Windows 8 Release Preview Is Here!


Windows 8 Release Preview (RP) is now available at <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download?ocid=W_MSC_W8P_DevCenter_Hardware>. The Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) for these releases is publicly available on the Microsoft Download Center (<http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/5/C/25CBD55D-29CF-402A-B1BE-B6A3F16FB502/wlk/HCKSetup.exe>), and the [Windows Hardware Developer Dashboard](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1389889743&rver=6.1.6206.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Fsysdev.microsoft.com%2FWLID%2FSignIn.ashx%3FReturnURL%3D%252fen-US%252fhardware%252fmember%252f&lc=1033&id=281915&mkt=en-US&cbcxt=hardware) has reopened and is now accepting Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 submissions for certification.

You can use the new HCK to create submissions for all currently covered operating systems. You may continue to use Windows Logo Kit 1.6 (WLK) to create submissions for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 for at least 90 days. We will provide 90 days' notice before retiring WLK. The Dashboard portal will accept submissions from either kit, but a single submission cannot mix test packages from both HCK and WLK.
