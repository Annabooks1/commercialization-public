## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [System Client Testing Prerequisites](system-client-testing-prerequisites.md).

Clean input is especially important in handwriting. It is critical that users can draw natural lines and curves that mimic the feeling of pen on paper; this can only be accomplished with clean, high-quality input.

To complete this test, use a straight edge to guide the pen along the lines that are rendered on the screen, from the green targets to the yellow targets. The test notifies you after all lines are completed.
