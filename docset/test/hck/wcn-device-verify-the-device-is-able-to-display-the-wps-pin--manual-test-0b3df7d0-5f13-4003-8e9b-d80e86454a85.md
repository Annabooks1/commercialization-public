# WCN Device Verify the device is able to display the WPS Pin (Manual Test)


This test verifies that the device is able to display the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) PIN.

The device should have a way to display the WPS PIN. If the WPS PIN is static, it should be printed on the device and should be exactly 8 numeric characters. If the WPS PIN is dynamic, then the device should have a way to display the current WPS PIN on the device (like an LCD display). A dynamic WPS PIN can be 4 or 8 numeric characters. The test will pass if the device meets the specified criteria and fail if it does not.
