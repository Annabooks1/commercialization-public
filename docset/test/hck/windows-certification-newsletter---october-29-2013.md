## <a href="" id="waiver1025"></a>Waiver: GML and Windows symbol placement


To address OEM feedback about the placement of the Genuine Microsoft Label (GML) on desktop devices and the Windows symbol when used on buttons on convertible and tablet devices, we’re providing the additional flexibility described below.

As for the GML, the current specifications require that it be placed on the back or side of a desktop device. We’re loosening this requirement so that the GML can now be placed on the bottom of the device to accommodate for smaller form factors where back or side placement isn’t optimal.

Also, all convertible and tablet devices now have the same flexibility currently defined for the placement of the Windows symbol on devices with an integrated display of less than 10 inches, measured diagonally. OEMs can now place the button with the logo in one of these locations on a convertible or tablet device:

-   Centered on the long bottom bezel.

-   Centered on the short bezel.

-   On the edge of the device, either centered or in either corner.

-   Immediately next to the button launching the required function, if placement on the button isn’t a viable option.

    **Note**  
    We recommend that partners review the Windows Engineering Guidance (WEG) to ensure that they use the most optimal placements and designs. Also, the logo orientation must match the default device orientation (landscape or portrait).

     

Both of these options are also subject to these requirements:

-   The devices must pass the criteria for all logos they display, as specified in the Logo License Agreement (LLA).

-   The devices must not display any Microsoft logo other than those authorized under the LLA.

-   The devices must meet all other terms of the LLA and all terms of the OEM license.

The obligations of the LLA are not waived or modified by this change, except as indicated above.

The LLA and all communications related to it are covered under the existing non-disclosure obligations between the OEM and Microsoft Corporation.

We’ve created some new videos to help you with your certification process.

To help you get up and running with the new release of the HCK, the videos at [What's New in Windows Hardware Certification Kit for Windows 8.1](whats-new-in-windows-hardware-certification-kit-for-windows-81.md) show off new features.

The videos at [Troubleshooting Windows HCK Test Failures](troubleshooting-windows-hck-test-failures.md) provide quick demonstrations of some troubleshooting steps.

And finally, since manual test setup can cause test failures, we’ve created a video to help you with the manual set up of the [Communications Audio Fidelity Test (Manual) - Certification](communications-audio-fidelity-test--manual----certification-8b2c652c-71c3-4f8b-a1d2-dc40cb660168.md).
