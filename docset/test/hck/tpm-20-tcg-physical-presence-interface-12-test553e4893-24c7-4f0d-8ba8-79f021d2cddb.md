# TPM 2.0 TCG Physical Presence Interface 1.2 Test


This test validates the supported PPI 1.2 commands on a TPM 2.0 implementation. In the setup steps, the test disables auto provisioning of the TPM and requests a TPM clear operation from firmware.

**Important**  
The test will restart the system several times.

## Running the test


Before you run the test, review the prerequisites in [TPM System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](tpm-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md).

This test requires secure boot debug policy to be installed on Windows RT devices and secure boot to be turned off on non-Windows RT devices. If operation 18 (SetNoPPIClear\_True) is not allowed for the operating system, then the noPPIClear flag must be manually set in the BIOS.

This test has no additional test parameters.

**Note**  
If GetUserConfirmationStatus for operations 6 and 22 is not 4 (PPI not required) then PPI operations 16 and 18 respectively should be issued to set the noPPIProvision and noPPIClear flags.

 

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting the Windows HCK Environment](troubleshooting-the-windows-hck-environment.md).

This test returns Pass or Fail. To review test details, review the test log from Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) Studio. To provide more information for troubleshooting failures in this test, you can enable tracing of the TPM. Refer to the steps provided under the Troubleshooting section in [TCG TPM Integration Test (Manual)](tcg-tpm-integration-test--manual-ac56901f-0f66-4013-b156-fe4b036cce60.md). Investigations also need log files with name like ‘tpm\*.txt’ and console.txt from the ‘Documents’ folder
