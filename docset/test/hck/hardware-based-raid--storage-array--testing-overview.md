# Hardware-based RAID (Storage Array) Testing Overview


Before you begin to test your hardware-based RAID storage array by using the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), you must review the prerequisites for the type of hardware array that you're testing. For more information, see the documentation that corresponds to the hardware array that you're testing:

-   [Hardware-based RAID Systems (iSCSI) Testing Prerequisites](hardware-based-raid-systems--iscsi--testing-prerequisites.md)

-   [Hardware-based Raid Systems (Fibre Channel, SAS, SCSI, Serial ATA) Testing Prerequisites](hardware-based-raid-systems--fibre-channel-sas-scsi-serial-ata--testing-prerequisites.md)
