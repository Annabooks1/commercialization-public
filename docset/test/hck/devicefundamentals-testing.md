# Device.Fundamentals Testing


This section describes how to test device fundamentals and certify them for use on Windows® as part of the Windows® Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows® Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), and set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure the Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).
