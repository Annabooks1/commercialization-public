# Troubleshooting Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) Driver Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) driver tests, follow these steps:

1.  Review [Troubleshooting Windows HCK Test Failures](troubleshooting-windows-hck-test-failures.md).

2.  Review the [Windows HCK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236110) for current test issues.

3.  For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HCK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.
