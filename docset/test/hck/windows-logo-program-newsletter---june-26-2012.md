## <a href="" id="discount"></a>Special Discount for Early Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 Submissions


The Windows Hardware Certification Program is now open for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 submissions. Take advantage of the early-bird submission prices. All Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 submissions are only $100 (US) until General Availability of these operating systems.

You can download the new Windows Hardware Certification Kit at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=241607>. Use this kit to create submissions for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

You can download Windows 8 Release Preview at <http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/download?ocid=W_MSC_W8P_DevCenter_Hardware>.

## <a href="" id="tvtuner"></a>Update on the TV Tuner and WMC Remote Control and Receiver Product Categories


The TV Tuner and Windows Media Center Remote Control and Receiver categories and tests are not included with Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) because we are retiring these programs. You can use HCK to obtain a Windows 8 signed driver for these devices by passing the applicable tests. For example, if the device connects via USB, then the USB tests would appear. The tests that appear depend on the features that are detected, but there are no Windows Media Center or TV tuner tests in HCK. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can use Windows 8 signed drivers as part of their pre-installation image.

Partners can still make submissions for the Windows 7 Logo Program in these categories, by using Windows Logo Kit version 1.6.

## <a href="" id="appcertkit"></a>Windows Application Certification Kit Is Required for All Client Software Submissions


The Windows Software Certification Program would like to remind our partners that software submissions to the Dashboard Services website must now use Windows Application Certification Kit (Windows ACK). Partners will no longer be able to use Windows Software Logo Kit (Windows SLK).

You can download Windows ACK from <http://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/aa904949>. 

## <a href="" id="logoart"></a>Logo Artwork Usage Guidelines


A new logo artwork package is now available for download on the [Windows Hardware Developer Dashboard](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1389888808&rver=6.1.6206.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Fsysdev.microsoft.com%2FWLID%2FSignIn.ashx%3FReturnURL%3D%252fen-US%252fhardware%252fmember%252f&lc=1033&id=281915&mkt=en-US&cbcxt=hardware) website. The new package contains artwork for both Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. This new artwork may not be used publicly until after Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 General Availability. We will provide more guidance on when and how to use the new Windows certification logos in future versions of this newsletter.
