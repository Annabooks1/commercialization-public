## Running the test


Secure Boot must be enabled in production mode and no debug policy is present before running this test. It should be run on a final image with drivers that have been certified.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](wdtf-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md).

## Troubleshooting


If the test fails, ensure that a debug policy is not installed. Check the test log file to see if a debug policy is installed.

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting System Fundamentals Testing](troubleshooting-system-fundamentals-testing.md).
