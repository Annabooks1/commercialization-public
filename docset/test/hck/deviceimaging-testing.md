# Device.Imaging Testing


This section describes how to test imaging devices (printers or scanners) as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) and set up your testing environment. For information about how to install and configure Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

Examples of the types of products in the Device.Imaging category include the following:

-   Networked or stand-alone printers

-   Multi-function printers (printers that include scanning, faxing, or other capabilities)

-   Flatbed, photo or slide scanners.

**Note**  
The completion of bus-specific or networking-specific tests is required if the printer or scanner includes USB connections, network features, or support for Web Services on Devices (WSD).

To obtain certification for your printer or scanner, your device must support all of the features in a product type. If your test device includes both printing and scanning capabilities, you should review the prerequisite topics for printers, scanners, and WSD-compliant devices.
