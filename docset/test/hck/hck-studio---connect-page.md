# HCK Studio - Connect Page


![connect page](images/hck-winb-connect-page-db.png)

The **Connect** option lets you view hckx files. This feature is useful if you need to share an .hckx file with another person.

An .hckx file is a compressed file format created by HCK Studio. An .hckx file, also known as a submission package, is what you submit for certification. An .hckx file must be digitally signed to be a valid submission package.

## View an .hckx package


HCK Studio supports viewing .hckx packages. For example, if you want to troubleshoot a test offline, you can open an existing .hckx package using the **Connect** option. In this mode, you can view all details of the project, including pass/fail results and log files.

**Important**  
You cannot open an .hckx package created from a previous release of the HCK. The version of HCK Studio and the package you want to view must be the same.

 

1.  From HCK Studio, click **Connect**.

2.  Select **Package** option, and then click **Browse** to open an existing .hckx package.
