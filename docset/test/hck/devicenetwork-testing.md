# Device.Network Testing


This section describes how to test network devices and certify them for use on Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) and setup your testing environment. For information about how to install and configure Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

The Device.Network testing category includes the following items:

-   Ethernet-based or wireless LAN adapters

-   Mobile phones (specifically when communicating over a Wi-Fi network)

-   Ethernet-based or wireless routers

-   Wireless networking devices

**Note**  
If your product includes other features (for example, USB-capabilities), completion of additional tests are required in addition to standard Device.network tests.
