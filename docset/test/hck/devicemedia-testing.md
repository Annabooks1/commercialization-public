# Device.Media Testing


This section describes how to test features in the Device.Media category, and certify them for use with Windows® as part of the Windows Certification Program. To begin the testing part of the certification process, you must install and run the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK), and then set up your test environment. For information about how to install and configure the Windows HCK, see [Step 1: Install Controller and Studio on the test server](step-1-install-controller-and-studio-on-the-test-server.md).

The Device.Media test category includes the following types of devices:

-   Digital media renderer (DMR). DMRs are devices that can receive digital media, such as cell phones, gaming devices, or computers.

This section includes the following topics.
