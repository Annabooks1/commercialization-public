## Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Graphic Adapter or Chipset Testing Prerequisites](graphic-adapter-or-chipset-testing-prerequisites.md).

**Note**  
If you run this test on a system without multiple monitors, you will be prompted to add a second monitor. If your device family does not support multimon, select "Continue" to force the test to run in single monitor configuration.

Some tests can only be run on systems with multiple monitors, in which case the test will be skipped.

 

## Troubleshooting


For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Graphics Testing](troubleshooting-devicegraphics-testing.md).
