## <a href="" id="help820"></a>Help! I’m getting a pop-up during the USB Descriptor Test


If you’re certifying a device on Windows 8 by using the Windows 8.1 HCK, you might get a security pop-up window. If you do, please click through the pop-up window by clicking **Install this driver software anyway** on the client machine. The test will continue, and the outcome of your test won’t be affected. If you don’t click through the pop-up window, the test might be cancelled and marked as failed. This pop-up window will be removed in the RTM version of the Windows 8.1 HCK.
