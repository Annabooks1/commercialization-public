# WiFi Direct FastDiscovery Tests


The WiFi Direct FastDiscovery tests perform a WFD scan-only to either targeted or wildcard discovery between two devices. Connection of the station port on each device can happen before the WFD discovery, after the WFD discovery, or not at all, depending on the APConnect parameters for each.

The topics in this section represent the WiFi Direct FastDiscovery tests.
