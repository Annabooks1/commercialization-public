# Windows Hardware Certification Kit User's Guide


The Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) is a test framework used to certify hardware devices for Windows. To qualify for a Windows certification, previously known as Windows logo, your product must pass testing using the Windows HCK.

This Windows HCK User’s Guide provides instructions on how to build a test environment, automate driver and system testing, and create a submission package required to obtain Windows Logo.
