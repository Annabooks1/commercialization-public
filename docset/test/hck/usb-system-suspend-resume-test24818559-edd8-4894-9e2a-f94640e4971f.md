# USB System Suspend Resume Test


This test verifies that a USB device continues to appear in Device Manager after the system resumes from S3 sleep state.

The test sends the system into S3 and then resumes the system. Upon system resume, the test seeks the device under test in the device manager to verify that it is both present and functional.

The suspend and resume cycle repeats 20 times. If the device under test is found upon resume every time, the test passes. If the device under test is no longer found in device manager, the test fails.
