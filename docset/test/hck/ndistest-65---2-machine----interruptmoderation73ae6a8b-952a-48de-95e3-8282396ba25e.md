# NDISTest 6.5 - 2 Machine - InterruptModeration


This test checks whether OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION is supported.

Interrupt Moderation reduces the number of interrupts generated by miniport drivers using the OID OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION. This feature is also useful for Quality of Service. When this OID is enabled, interrupts are generated only after packets greater than a threshold level has arrived or a time interval has passed and when turned off interrupts are generated for each packet received. The threshold and the time interval are specific to the manufacturer. You can also verify that the interrupts generated by the miniport driver have decreased when the OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION feature is enabled.
