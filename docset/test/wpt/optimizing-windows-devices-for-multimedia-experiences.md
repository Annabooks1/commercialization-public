# Optimizing Windows Devices for Multimedia Experiences


Customers expect a smooth and glitch free experience when they stream movies, listen to music, video conference with Skype, and create media content. This lab provides an introduction to **Media eXperience Analyzer (MXA)**, a visual performance analysis tool that enables engineers to validate and optimize quality, performance, and latency for media scenarios. This hands-on lab also covers the following topics:

-   Assessing audio latency performance and quality for communications scenarios.

-   Analyzing audio glitches and verifying audio is offloaded using **MXA**.

-   Collecting Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logs for Media Scenarios using **Windows Performance Recorder (WPR)**.

## Goals


This guide introduces the low latency audio communications and low latency audio glitch tests. By the end of this guide, you will have a better understanding of how the **MXA** visualizing tool can be used to analyze ETW logs and identify opportunities to improve multimedia experiences on Windows devices.

## Exercises


This guide consists of the following exercises.

-   [Exercise 1 - Assess the Device's Audio Latency Performance for Communications Scenarios](optimizing-windows-devices-for-multimedia-experiences-exercise-1.md)

-   [Exercise 2 - Manually Collect ETW Logs for Media Scenarios Using WPR](optimizing-windows-devices-for-multimedia-experiences-exercise-2.md)

-   [Exercise 3 - Use MXA to Verify that Audio is Offloaded During Full Screen Video Playback](optimizing-windows-devices-for-multimedia-experiences-exercise-3.md)

-   [Exercise 4 - Use MXA to Analyze Audio Glitches](optimizing-windows-devices-for-multimedia-experiences-exercise-4.md)
