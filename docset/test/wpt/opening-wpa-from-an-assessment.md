# Opening WPA from an Assessment


From the results page of an assessment made with the Assessment Platform, you can click the **Windows Performance Analyzer** link in the Issues window to open the assessment results in Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). The same issues that appeared in the Assessment Platform are displayed in the upper-right corner of WPA in the Issues window.

The **Analysis** tab in WPA gives a summary report of the issues identified in the assessment.
