This procedure describes how to change the detail level of logging for a recording in the Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) user intface (UI). For information about how to start a recording from the command line, see [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md).

**To change the detail level**

1.  On the WPR screen, if the options are hidden, click **More options**.

2.  In the **Detail level** drop-down list, select the detail level that you want. **Verbose** is the default level.
