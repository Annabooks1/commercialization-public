# Search or Filter Data


In Windows Performance Analyzer, you can search all the text in data tables. You can also filter data to display only a selection of the data in both the graph and its data table.

**To search for text in a data table**

1.  Right-click the table, and then click **Find**.

2.  Enter the desired text.

3.  To find the next instance of the text, right-click the table, and then click **Find Next**.

4.  To find the previous instance of the text, right-click the table, and then click **Find Previous**.

**To filter data in a graph and its data table**

1.  In the data table, select the desired row or rows. Or, in the **Legend** control to the left of the graph, select the desired item or items.

2.  Right-click the data table, and then click **Filter To Selection**.

If you want to enable or disable a whole series, right-click the **Legend** control, and then select the desired option.

**To filter out data in a graph and its data table**

1.  In the data table, select the desired row or rows. Or, in the **Legend** control to the left of the graph, select the desired item or items.

2.  Right-click the data table, and then click **Filter Out Selection**.

If you want to enable or disable a whole series, right-click the **Legend** control, and then select the desired option.

**To undo a filter**

-   Right-click the data table, and click **Undo Filter**.

**To redo a filter**

-   Right-click the data table, and click **Redo Filter**.

**To clear a filter**

-   Right-click the data table, and click **Clear Filter**.

**To choose columns to display in a data table**

1.  In the data table, right-click the title bar.

2.  In the **Column Chooser** box, select or clear the desired columns individually. Or, in the **Preset** drop-down list, select the desired preset combination of columns.

    The data table is immediately updated as you click.

    For more information about presets, see [Apply, Create, or Delete a Preset Combination of Columns to Display](apply-create-or-delete-a-preset-combination-of-columns-to-display.md).
