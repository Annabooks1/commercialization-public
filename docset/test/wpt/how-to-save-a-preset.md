# How to Save a Preset


In Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), when you change the preset combination of columns that display, you can save it. This lets you not only create custom presets that are "one off" from an existing preset, but save them for future use.

**To save a preset**

1.  On the **Analysis** tab of the preset graph you changed, click the dropdown menu and then click **Save As**. A Save As dialog opens.

    **Note**  
    An asterisk (\*) displays when you change the preset graph.

     

2.  Enter the name you want to give the new graph preset, and then click **Save**.

**Note**  
If you do not want to save your changes (to create a new preset graph), click **Reset**.
