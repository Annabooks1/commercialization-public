# Diagnostic Console


The Diagnostic Console window appears at the bottom of the workspace when you first open Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), but you can drag it out to a separate window or dock it at the top or side. It lists information about exceptions that occur during analysis workflow.

You can diagnose symbol decoding issues from this console.
