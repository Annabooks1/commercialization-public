# Recording On/Off Transitions


Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) includes built-in profiles for on/off transitions. You can record the following types of boot transition:

-   **On/Off - Boot**: Records performance while booting the computer.

-   **On/Off - FastStartup**: Records performance during a Windows 8 Windows 8’s fast startup operation.

-   **On/Off - Shutdown**: Records performance while shutting the computer down.

-   **On/Off - RebootCycle**: Records performance during the entire cycle while rebooting.

-   **On/Off - Standby/Resume**: Records performance when the computer is placed on standby, and then resumed.

-   **On/Off - Hibernate/Resume**: Records performance when the computer is placed in hibernation, and then resumed.

By default, these profiles reboot the computer three times.

*On/off* transitions are always logged to a file.
