# Details Window


Use the Details window to view detailed information about the issue selected in the Issues window, along with recommended solutions.

If your recording was not made with the Assessment Platform, this window is closed by default because there is no data to display.

## Using the Details Window


The details in this window can serve as a starting point for your investigation, or you can implement the recommended solutions directly. The **Assisted Diagnostics** section at the bottom of the **Analysis** tab also contains information about all issues listed in the Issues window.

You can detach this window and drag it anywhere on your desktop, or resize or close it. To dock it, drag it to any of the docking points at the top, bottom, or right or left sides of the UI until the area is highlighted. Then, release the cursor.

If this window is not open, click **Details** on the **Window** menu.
