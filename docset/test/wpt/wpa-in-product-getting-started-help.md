# Windows Performance Analyzer in-product Getting Started Guide


When you open Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), by default, the Getting Started tab is displayed. Getting Started is in-product help that provides an overview (with corresponding topics) to help you successfully ramp up into analyzing traces with WPA.

It features the following topics:

**Note**  
These topics feature basic information for getting started. For more in-depth information, refer to the Related Topics at the end of this topic.

 

-   Get Started: Provides instructions for three basic scenarios: opening a trace file, configuring symbols, and applying a profile.

<!-- -->

-   Basic Actions: Provides instructions for using the Analysis Assistant, highlighting a time interval, and zooming, searching, and filtering data.

<!-- -->

-   View Data: Explains graphs and data tables.

<!-- -->

-   Customization: Briefly explains customization.

<!-- -->

-   Demos: Features links to videos that demonstrate Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) basics, advanced customizations, and Store App analysis.

    **Note**  
    These topics open in a separate browser window.

     

**To close Getting Started**

-   Hover on the Getting Started tab and click **X**.

    **Note**  
    By default, Getting Started opens every time you open WPA. If, during your session, you close Getting Started, you can reopen it to display in the product - even when the Analysis tab is open.
