# Xperf Backward Compatibility Support


Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) continues to support command-line recordings that you create by using **Xperf.exe** and **Xbootmgr.exe**. However, Xperfview is no longer supported. Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) can open recordings that you create by using Xperf, Xbootmgr, or WPR, or recordings that are created by the Assessment Platform. For command-line reference material for Xperf, see [Xperf Command-Line Reference](xperf-command-line-reference.md).
