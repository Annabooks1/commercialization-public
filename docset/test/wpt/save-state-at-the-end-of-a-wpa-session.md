# Save State at the End of a WPA Session


You can save the state of a Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) session so that you can re-open it later.

**To save the state of your current WPA session**

1.  On the **File** menu, click **Export Session.**

2.  Give the file a name, and click **Save**.

    The file is saved with a .wpa extension in the WPA Files folder in your Documents folder.
