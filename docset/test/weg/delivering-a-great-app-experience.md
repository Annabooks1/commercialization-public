| HTML Performance Tool in Visual Studio 2012 Update 2                                   |  Tool        |  This tool is meant to help developers solve issues with UI responsiveness (why is my UI thread blocked?) and latency in visual updates (my UI thread is responsive but visual changes are taking longer than expected to display). It does this by presenting a holistic set of "events" (logical categorization of CPU utilization) that occurred during a period of time, which includes both application logic as well as platform behavior that occurred on behalf of your application (e.g. layout, GC, network request, image decoding time).|  [Microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2797912/) |
