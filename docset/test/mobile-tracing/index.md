# Mobile software tracing


Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is an efficient kernel-level tracing facility that lets you log kernel or application-defined events to a log file.

You can consume the events and use them to debug an application or to determine where performance issues are occurring in the application. ETW lets you enable or disable event tracing dynamically, allowing you to perform detailed tracing in a production environment without requiring device or application restarts.
