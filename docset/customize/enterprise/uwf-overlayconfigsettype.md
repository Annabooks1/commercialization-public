# UWF\_OverlayConfig.SetType


Sets the type of the Unified Write Filter (UWF) overlay to either RAM-based or disk-based.

## Syntax


``` syntax
UInt32 SetType(
    UInt32 type
);
```

## Parameters


<a href="" id="type"></a>*type*  
The type of overlay. Set to **0** for a RAM-based overlay; set to **1** for a disk-based overlay.

## Return Value


Returns an HRESULT value that indicates [WMI status](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=208318) or a [WMI error](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=208317).

## Remarks


Changes to the overlay type take effect during the next device restart in which UWF is enabled.

When you change the overlay type from RAM-based to disk-based, UWF creates a file on the system volume. The file has a size equal to the **MaximumSize** property of [UWF\_OverlayConfig](uwf-overlayconfig.md).

Before you can change the overlay type to disk-based, your device must meet the following requirements.

-   UWF must be disabled in the current session.

-   The system volume on your device must have available free space greater than the maximum size of the overlay.

-   The maximum size of the overlay must be at least 1024 MB.

Before you can change the overlay type to RAM-based, your device must meet the following requirements.

-   UWF must be disabled in the current session.
