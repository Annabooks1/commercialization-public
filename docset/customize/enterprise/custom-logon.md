# Custom Logon


You can use the Custom Logon feature to suppress Windows 10 UI elements that relate to the Welcome screen and shutdown screen. For example, you can suppress all elements of the Welcome screen UI and provide a custom logon UI. You can also suppress the Blocked Shutdown Resolver (BSDR) screen and automatically end applications while the OS waits for applications to close before a shutdown.

Custom Logon settings do not modify the credential behavior of **Winlogon**, so you can use any credential provider that is compatible with Windows 10 to provide a custom sign-in experience for your device.

## Requirements


Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Education.

## Terminology


**Turn on, enable:** To make the setting available to the device and optionally apply the settings to the device. Generally *turn on* is used in the user interface or control panel, whereas *enable* is used for command line.

**Configure:** To customize the setting or sub-settings.

**Embedded Logon:**This feature is called Embedded Logon in Windows 10, version 1511.

**Custom Logon:**This feature is called Custom Logon in Windows 10, version 1607 and later.

## <a href="" id="turn-on-logon"></a>Turn on Custom Logon


Custom Logon is an optional component and is not turned on by default in Windows 10. It must be turned on prior to configuring. You can turn on and configure Custom Logon in a customized Windows 10 image (.wim) if Microsoft Windows has not been installed. If Windows has already been installed and you are applying a provisioning package to configure Custom Logon, you must first turn on Custom Logon in order for a provisioning package to be successfully applied.

The Custom Logon feature is available in the Control Panel. You can set Custom Logon by following these steps:

**Turn on Custom Logon in Control Panel**

1.  In the **Search the web and Windows** field, type **Turn Windows features on or off**.
2.  For Windows 10, version 1511, in the **Windows Features** box, select **Embedded Logon**.

    For Windows 10, version 1607, in the **Windows Features** window, expand the **Device Lockdown** node, and select or clear the checkbox for **Custom Logon**.

When you use

**Turn on and configure Custom Logon using DISM**

1.  Open a command prompt with administrator rights.
2.  Copy install.wim to a temporary folder on hard drive (in the following steps, we'll assume it's called C:\\wim).
3.  Create a new directory.

    ```
    md c:\wim
    ```

4.  Mount the image.

    ```
    dism /mount-wim /wimfile:c:\bootmedia\sources\install.wim /index:1 /MountDir:c:\wim
    ```

5.  Enable the feature.

    ```
    dism /image:c:\wim /enable-feature /featureName:Client-EmbeddedLogon
    ```

6.  Commit the change.

    ```
    dism /unmount-wim /MountDir:c:\wim /Commit
    ```

## Turn on and configure Custom Logon settings using Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD)


The Custom Logon settings are also available as Windows provisioning settings so you can configure these settings to be applied during the image deployment time or runtime. You can set one or all Custom Logon settings by creating a provisioning package using Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) and then applying the provisioning package during image deployment time or runtime. If Windows has not been installed and you are using Windows ICD to create installation media with settings for Custom Logon included in the image or you are applying a provisioning package during setup you must turn on Custom Logon on the installation media with DISM in order for a provisioning package to be successfully applied.

1.  Build a provisioning package in Windows ICD by following the instructions in [Build and apply a provisioning package](p_icd.create_a_provisioning_package).
    **Note**  In the **Select Windows Edition** window, choose **Common to all Windows desktop editions**.

     

2.  In the Available customizations page, select **Runtime settings** &gt; **SMISettings** and then set the value for the following Custom Logon settings.
    -   BrandingNeutral = TRUE
    -   AnimationDisabled = TRUE
    -   NoLockScreen = TRUE
    -   UIVerbosityLevel =
    -   HideAutoLogonUI = TRUE

3.  Once you have finished configuring the settings and building the provisioning package, you can apply the package to the image deployment time or runtime. See the To apply a provisioning package to a Windows 10 for desktop editions image section in [Build and apply a provisioning package](p_icd.create_a_provisioning_package) for more information. Note that the process for applying the image to a Windows 10 Enterprise is the same.

### Configure Custom Logon settings using Unattend

You can configure the Unattend settings in the [Microsoft-Windows-Embedded-EmbeddedLogon](p_unattend.microsoft-windows-embedded-embeddedlogon) component to add custom logon features to your image during the design or imaging phase. You can manually create an Unattend answer file or use Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM) to add the appropriate settings to your answer file. For more information about the custom logon settings and XML examples, see the settings in Microsoft-Windows-Embedded-EmbeddedLogon.

The following example shows how to disable all Welcome screen UI elements and the **Switch user** button.

```XML
<settings pass="specialize">
    <component name="Microsoft-Windows-Embedded-EmbeddedLogon" processorArchitecture="x86" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" language="neutral" versionScope="nonSxS" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
      <BrandingNeutral>17</BrandingNeutral>
      <AnimationDisabled>1</AnimationDisabled>
      <NoLockScreen>1</NoLockScreen>
      <UIVerbosityLevel>1</UIVerbosityLevel>
      <HideAutoLogonUI>1</HideAutoLogonUI>
    </component>
</settings>
```
