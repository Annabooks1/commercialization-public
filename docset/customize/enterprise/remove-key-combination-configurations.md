# Remove key combination configurations


The following sample Windows PowerShell script uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers for Keyboard Filter to create two functions to remove custom-defined key combination configurations from Keyboard Filter. It demonstrates several ways to use each function.

The first function, **Remove-Custom-Key**, removes custom key combination configurations.

The second function, **Remove-Scancode**, removes custom scan code configurations.

You cannot remove the predefined key combination configurations for Keyboard Filter, but you can disable them.

function Remove-Custom-Key($Id) {
    <#
    .Synopsis
        Remove an instance of WEKF_CustomKey

        This removes the instance of WEKF_CustomKey with a key Id of "Ctrl+V"

    $customInstance = Get-WMIObject -class WEKF_CustomKey @CommonParams |
        where {$_.Id -eq $Id}

    if ($customInstance) {
        $customInstance.Delete();
        "Removed Custom Filter $Id.";
    } else {
        "Custom Filter $Id does not exist.";
    }
}

function Remove-Scancode($Modifiers, [int]$Code) {

        This removes the instance of WEKF_Scancode with Modifiers="Ctrl" and
        Scancode=37.
#>

    $scancodeInstance = Get-WMIObject -class WEKF_Scancode @CommonParams |
        where {($_.Modifiers -eq $Modifiers) -and ($_.Scancode -eq $Code)}

    if ($scancodeInstance) {
        $scancodeInstance.Delete();
        "Removed Scancode $Modifiers+$Code.";
    } else {
        "Scancode $Modifiers+$Code does not exist.";
    }
}

Remove-Custom-Key "Ctrl+V"
Remove-Custom-Key "Numpad0"
Remove-Custom-Key "Shift+Numpad1"
