<td><p>[Active phone cover settings](active-phone-cover-settings.md)</p></td>
<td><p>OEMs can create and register an active phone cover app, which allows partners to create a user experience with their mobile device cover accessories. This app must be preloaded on the phone as a Settings/CPL application.</p></td>

<td><p>[Customize the SIM toolkit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt629102)</p></td>
<td><p>OEMs can change the display duration for certain SIM toolkit UI dialogs or messages if the default values do not meet the requirements of the mobile operator.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>[Enhanced apps experience for medium and large screens](enhanced-apps-experience-for-medium-and-large-screens.md)</p></td>
<td><p>OEMs can use the <strong>UserPreferenceWidth</strong> setting to override the default behavior based on the screen size and specify the physical width of the device (instead of using the automatically calculated <strong>HORZSIZE</strong> value). The value for <strong>UserPreferenceWidth</strong> influences the screen resolution scale factor. A reboot is required for the change to take effect on the chrome process or any apps that are already running. Note that this only has a meaningful impact on 720 x 1280 and 1080 x 1920 devices.</p></td>
