# Enable static IP


To facilitate Wi-Fi certification tests, OEMs can enable a screen from the Wi-Fi settings screen that provides UI elements that allow you to specify a static IP address, gateway address, and DNS server address.

To enable the **Static IP** UI, set the value of the `EnableStaticIP` setting to 1. If the setting is not set, or is set to any value other than 1, the static IP UI is not enabled. When enabled, the Wi-Fi **Static IP** UI button appears directly below the **Advanced** button in the Wi-Fi settings screen.

**Warning**  
The static IP UI must only be used for certification purposes and not for production or retail devices.
