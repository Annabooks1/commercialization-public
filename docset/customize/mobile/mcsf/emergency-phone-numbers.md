# Emergency phone numbers


Partners can edit the list of valid emergency phone numbers for the market in which the phone will be sold.

By default, the list includes 911, 112, 08, and 999. The number 112 is hardcoded and cannot be removed. The emergency numbers apply when the dialer restricts the user to approved emergency phone numbers, such as during initial phone setup and when the phone is locked. Partners can specify which numbers can be dialed when a SIM is present and when no SIM is present.

The emergency phone numbers are implemented by the modem vendor. For more information about how to modify the emergency dialing behavior, see the documentation provided by the modem vendor.
