# Sort order for contacts


OEMs can use this customization to set the list of contacts displayed in the People Hub to be organized by last name instead of first name or first name instead of last name. It is also possible to change the display format of contact names to appear as “First name Last name” or “Last name First name” for markets that use more formal nomenclature.
