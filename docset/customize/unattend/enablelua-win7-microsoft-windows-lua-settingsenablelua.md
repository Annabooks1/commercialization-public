# EnableLUA


`EnableLUA` specifies whether Windows® User Account Controls (UAC) notifies the user when programs try to make changes to the computer. UAC was formerly known as Limited User Account (LUA).

## Values


<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>true</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Windows notifies the user when programs try to make changes to the computer.</p>
<p>This is the default value.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>false</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Windows does not notify the user when programs try to install software or make changes to the computer.</p>
<p>We do not recommend using this setting, but it can be selected for systems that use programs that are not certified for Windows 8, Windows Server® 2012, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 because they do not support UAC.</p></td>
