# ExtendOSPartition


`ExtendOSPartition` specifies whether to extend the partition on which you are installing Windows. This setting is required for scenarios in which a customer has installed the Windows image by using a sector-based imaging solution and now plans on extending the partition.

These settings are valid only for NTFS file-system partitions.
