# ThemeName


`ThemeName` specifies the name of a theme.

Themes enable users to customize elements of the Windows® visual style, including elements such as the desktop, background, and screen saver.

**Note**  NOTE: In Windows 10, if you use this (DesktopBackground/ThemeName) setting, you’ll also need to set (ThemeName/DesktopBackground).
