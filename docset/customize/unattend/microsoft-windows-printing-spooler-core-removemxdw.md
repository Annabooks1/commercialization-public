# RemoveMXDW


The `RemoveMXDW` setting is used to remove the Microsoft® XPS Document Writer (MXDW) print queue and driver package from a Windows installation.

**To create a Windows image without the MXDW print queue and driver package**

1.  In your answer file, set `RemoveMXDW` to **1**.

2.  In your answer file, remove the MXDW print queue and driver package installation files. To do this, add the Microsoft-Windows-Printing-XPSServices-Package package. In the **Actions** field, select **Remove**. For more information, see [Packages](aa238f9a-b69d-4761-a966-90f8e809d3fb).

3.  Install Windows using your answer file.

4.  After installation, open the Printers folder to completely remove the files.

5.  Run the Sysprep tool, and then recapture the Windows image.

This setting has no effect on Server Core installations of Windows Server® 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012.
