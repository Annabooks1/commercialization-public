# ComplianceCheck


`ComplianceCheck` checks that the following requirements are fulfilled so that Windows® can be installed:

-   Valid hardware configuration.

-   Power management disabled.

-   No cluster sizes of larger than 4 kilobytes (KB).

-   In-box drivers available.

-   Product key matches available hardware. Windows® 7 Starter and Windows Vista® Starter can be installed only on the following types of central processing unit (CPU):

    -   Intel Celeron and Intel Pentium III processors, including mobile versions, except for Intel Pentium III Xeon processors.

    -   AMD Duron, AMD Sempron, and AMD Geode processors, including mobile versions.

    -   64-bit processors work only if they belong to one of the processors listed above. However, such processors are limited to 32-bit mode.

-   No SMART failures on installation disk.

-   Sufficient disk space.

-   Valid operating system or Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).

-   All run-once items have finished.

-   There is no pending reboot on the computer.

`ComplianceCheck` also checks that the existing operating system is one of the following:

-   Windows 2000, Service Pack 4 or later.

-   Windows XP, Service Pack 2 or later.

-   Windows Server 2000, Service Pack 1 or later.

-   Windows Server 2003.

-   Windows Server 2008.

-   Windows Server 2008 R2.

-   Windows Vista.

-   Windows 7.

**Important**  
`ComplianceCheck` does not validate application compatibility. See the software vendor for application compatibility requirements.

 

The user is also warned if any of the following conditions apply (provided [DisplayReport](displayreport-win7-microsoft-windows-setupcompliancecheckdisplayreport.md) is set to **OnError**). Otherwise, the user must boot from installation media and perform a clean installation instead of an upgrade.

-   There are SMART failures, and no alternate disk is available.

-   There is insufficient space for temporary files for Windows Setup or for total installation.

-   A newer version of the loader is already on the destination computer. This applies to dual-boot scenarios only.
