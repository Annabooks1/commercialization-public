# Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE


The Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE component is used to add one or more out-of-box drivers to a Windows installation. Drivers located in the path specified by [DriverPaths](microsoft-windows-pnpcustomizationsnonwinpedriverpaths.md) are copied to the driver store of the Windows installation during the auditSystem configuration pass. When the system runs Plug and Play, these out-of-box drivers are available to install hardware on the computer.
