# EnableCaptureMonitor


`EnableCaptureMonitor` specifies whether Windows® includes an option to play audio from devices connected to the **Audio In** port. The computer actively detects whether a device is connected to an **Audio In** port.

If this option is enabled, then the end user can configure the system to play audio from a device. For example, the end user can plug in a portable music player and listen to music through the computer speakers.
