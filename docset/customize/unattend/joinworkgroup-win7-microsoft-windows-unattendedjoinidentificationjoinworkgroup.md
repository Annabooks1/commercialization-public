# JoinWorkgroup


`JoinWorkgroup` specifies the name of the workgroup to assign to a computer. If this value is set, [JoinDomain](joindomain-win7-microsoft-windows-unattendedjoinidentificationjoindomain.md) cannot be set.

## Values


<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><em>JoinWorkgroup</em></p></td>
<td><p>Specifies the name of the workgroup to apply to a computer during Windows Setup. <em>JoinWorkgroup</em> is a string and must be a valid NetBIOS name.</p>
<p>You can specify either a domain to join or a workgroup to assign, by using [JoinDomain](joindomain-win7-microsoft-windows-unattendedjoinidentificationjoindomain.md) or <em>JoinWorkgroup</em> settings, respectively. However, only one of these settings can be present in an answer file. If both are present in an answer file, the value for <em>JoinDomain</em> is used, and <em>JoinWorkgroup</em> is ignored.</p></td>
