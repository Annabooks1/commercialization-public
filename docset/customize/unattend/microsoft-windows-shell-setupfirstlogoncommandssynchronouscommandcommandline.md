# CommandLine


`CommandLine` specifies the path to the [SynchronousCommand](microsoft-windows-shell-setupfirstlogoncommandssynchronouscommand.md) to be run at first logon.

If you create a user account that does not include administrative privileges, the following commands may not be executed:

-   If User Account Control is enabled, then when that user logs in for the first time, a dialog box appears, prompting the user with an option to allow an administrator to apply the commands. If the user selects **Cancel**, these commands are not executed.

-   If User Account Control is disabled, these commands are not executed.

When you add a script using FirstLogonCommands, it will be triggered on the next boot, even if you boot into audit mode using Ctrl+Shift+F3. If you plan to use audit mode later, add the following setting to skip this script automatically: Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\\Reseal\\[Mode](microsoft-windows-deploymentresealmode.md) = Audit.
