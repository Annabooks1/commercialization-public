# RunSynchronousCommand


`RunSynchronousCommand` specifies a single command to run during the windowsPE configuration pass.

To start a command that needs to finish before other commands can start, use synchronous commands. To run services or commands that can start at the same time, use [RunAsynchronousCommand](runasynchronouscommand-win7-microsoft-windows-setuprunasynchronousrunasynchronouscommand.md) instead.

All `RunSynchronous` commands run in the system context.
