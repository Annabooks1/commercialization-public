# RunSynchronous


`RunSynchronous` specifies one or more commands to run during the windowsPE configuration pass.

Synchronous commands start in the order that you specify in the unattended installation answer file, and each command must finish before the next command starts.

To start a command that needs to finish before other commands can start, use synchronous commands. To run services or commands that can start at the same time, use [RunAsynchronous](microsoft-windows-setuprunasynchronous.md) instead. `RunSynchronous` commands always run before RunAsynchronous commands in the same pass.

All `RunSynchronous` commands run in the system context.
