# ProtectYourPC


`ProtectYourPC` specifies whether Express settings are used to:

-   Personalize speech, typing, and inking input by sending contacts and calendar details, along with other associated input data to Microsoft.

-   Let Windows and apps request the user's localization, including location history, and use the advertising ID to personalize experiences on the device.

-   Turn on protection from malicious web content and use page prediction to preload sites in Windows browsers, which sends the browsing history to Microsoft.

-   Automatically connect to suggested open and shared networks.

-   Send problem reports to Microsoft.

**Note**  The functionality for `ProtectYourPC` has changed for Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education). In previous releases, this setting specified whether Windows Update installed important and recommended updates automatically.
