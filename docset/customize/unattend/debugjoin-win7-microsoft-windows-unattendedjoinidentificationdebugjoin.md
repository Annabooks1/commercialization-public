# DebugJoin


`DebugJoin` specifies a trigger to run the debugging routine if setup encounters an error code. This setting enables you to debug Windows Setup failures. Additionally, if a specific error code is used with [DebugJoinOnlyOnThisError](debugjoinonlyonthiserror-win7-microsoft-windows-unattendedjoinidentificationdebugjoinonlyonthiserror.md), `DebugJoin` will apply only for failures with the specified error code. For more information, see DebugJoinOnlyOnThisError.

**Important**  
This is an advanced setting designed to be used by product development and Microsoft Product Support Services. Leave this setting unmodified when you configure the unattended answer file.

If `DebugJoin` is specified, a trace file is generated during the domain join process (%WINDIR%\\Panther\\UnattendGC\\UnattendedJoinDCLocator.etl). This trace file can be useful for diagnosing network connectivity issues during setup that might prevent domain join from succeeding.
