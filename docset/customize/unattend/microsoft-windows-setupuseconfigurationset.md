# UseConfigurationSet


`UseConfigurationSet` specifies whether to use a configuration set for Windows Setup.

A configuration set is a folder that contains additional device drivers, applications, or other binaries that you want to add to Windows during installation. You can create a configuration set in Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM). Configuration sets are useful when a network share is not available. Configuration sets can be stored on removable media and used to install Windows in the field. Creating a configuration set in Windows SIM exports binaries referenced in the unattended installation answer file and puts them together into a self-contained file set. Windows SIM automatically appends the paths to the configuration set when it validates and saves the answer file.
