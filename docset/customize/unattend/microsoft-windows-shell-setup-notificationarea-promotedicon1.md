# PromotedIcon1


`PromotedIcon1` specifies an icon to be shown in the visible system notification area on the taskbar in place of the **Action Center** icon.

Up to four system notification icons are shown in the visible portion of the system notification area on the desktop. By default, these icons are **Action Center**, **Battery**—if the system hardware includes battery support—**Network**, and **Volume**.

By setting the **PromotedIcon1** component, you can select another icon to be visible in the system notification area. This icon will appear in place of the **Action Center** icon.

To select the icon to be visible, you must:

-   Select an application file that includes a system notification icon. This application file must be signed.

-   Set both the **Path** and **GUID** elements for the file.

For information about specifying the GUID for your icon, see [NOTIFYICONDATA Structure](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120340).
