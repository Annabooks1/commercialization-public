# Windows System Image Manager Overview Topics


Windows® System Image Manager (Windows SIM) is a GUI that you use to create and manage answer files. Answer files are .xml files that are used in Windows Setup, **Sysprep**, Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM), and other deployment tools to configure and customize the default Windows installation.

You can use answer files to customize different aspects of Windows, including the default language settings, the partitions to create and format during installation, and the default settings for the Windows Internet Explorer® home page.

You can use Windows SIM to do the following:

-   Create and manage answer files.

-   Validate the settings of an answer file against a Windows image (.wim) file.

-   View all of the configurable component settings in a Windows image.

-   Create a configuration set that contains a complete set of portable folders with Setup files.

-   Add third-party drivers, applications, or other packages to an answer file.
