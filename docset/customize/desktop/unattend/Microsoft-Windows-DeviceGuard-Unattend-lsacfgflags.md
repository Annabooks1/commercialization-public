# LsaCfgFlags


Use to enable the Credential Guard, which uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them when they are stored on disk or in memory. For more information, see [Credential Guard]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623856).

**Important**  You must first use DISM to add the virtualization-based security features before you apply this Unattend setting. For more information, see *Add the virtualization-based security features by using DISM* in [Credential Guard]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=623856).
