# Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client


The Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client component contains settings for configuring the Domain Name System (DNS), a system for naming computers and network services that organizes them into a hierarchy of domains. DNS naming is used on TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet, to locate computers and services by using user-friendly names.

The DNS Client service is used to resolve DNS domain names, by querying locally cached information obtained from a previous query or by querying a remote DNS server.

Some settings are global, and others are interface-specific. Global settings apply to all network adapters on the computer. Interface-specific settings apply only to a single interface and may overlap with global settings.
