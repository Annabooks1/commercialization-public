# Compact


Specifies whether the Windows image should be applied with compression enabled during installation. If set to **true**, files written to the disk during installation are compressed individually, which allows Windows to take up less disk space.

**Note**  
If the **Compact** setting is set to true, you must start Windows Setup from Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education), from a previous version of Windows with the Windows 10 Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) installed, or from the Windows 10 version of the Windows Preinstallation Environment (PE). If you are using a previous version of Windows PE, the Windows overlay filter driver (wofadk.sys) from the Windows 10 ADK must be included in the Windows PE image.
