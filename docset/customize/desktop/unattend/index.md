# Unattended Windows Setup Reference


The Windows Unattended Setup Reference provides a complete listing of all the settings that you can use to automate the configuration and the deployment of Windows 10.

The Windows Unattended Setup Reference is organized by Windows components and Windows packages, in the same order that the Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM) tool displays each Windows component and package.

Each Windows component includes settings that can be used to create an unattended-installation answer file. Each setting in a component is listed in its own individual topic. If an element contains a value, valid value types are described and XML examples are given.

Information about how to use Windows SIM and other deployment tools is available in the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) Technical Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=206587).
