# SupportAppURL


`SupportAppURL` specifies the OEM-built support app that will be launched instead of the web URL.

## Values


Set the value to your app's protocol handler, which is the value that's registered in your app's manifest file.

For example, in the following app manifest file snippet, the **Protocol Name** is **contoso-contact-support** so this will be the value that will be used for `SupportAppURL`:

``` syntax
      <Extensions>
        <uap:Extension Category="windows.protocol">
          <uap:Protocol Name="contoso-contact-support">
            <uap:DisplayName>contoso-resource:appDisplayName</uap:DisplayName>
          </uap:Protocol>
        </uap:Extension>
      </Extensions>
```
