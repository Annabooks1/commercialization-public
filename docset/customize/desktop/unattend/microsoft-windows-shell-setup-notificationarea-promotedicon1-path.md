# Path


`Path` specifies the path to an application. This application should contain an icon to be shown in the visible system notification area on the taskbar.

By setting the **Path** and [GUID](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-notificationarea-promotedicon1-guid.md) elements of the **PromotedIcon1** component, you can configure another icon to be visible in the system notification area. This icon will appear in place of the **Action Center** icon.

To select the icon to be visible, you must:

-   Select a signed binary application file that includes a system notification icon.

-   Set both the **Path** and **GUID** elements for the file.

For information about finding the path and GUID for your icon, see [NOTIFYICONDATA Structure](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120340).
