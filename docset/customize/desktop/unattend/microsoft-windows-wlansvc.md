# Microsoft-Windows-Wlansvc


The Microsoft-Windows-Wlansvc component implements:

-   System capabilities for Wi-Fi adapters, which are new for Windows 10. These system capabilities are added at image time to ensure that the information is at its most accurate. The capabilities allow the OS to have a better understanding of the underlying hardware that it's running on. Telemetry data is generated by the system to provide data that can be used to diagnose both software and hardware issues.

    OEMs or ODMs can configure the system capabilities for Wi-Fi adapters to accurately provide the information during image creation time. These system capabilities are different from device capabilities, which the IHV that developed the WLAN driver, provides. System capabilities are only locked down after the OEM or ODM has assembled a complete system and an understanding of the WLAN radio is available. For example, an OEM can configure a 2X2 WLAN device as a 1X1 device so the OEM must relay this configuration information to the OS using the system capabilities.

    If OEMs or ODMs don't use these system capabilities or no additional input is registered by the OS, the OS will not generate any default values to store in the registry.

    The settings you can use to enable system capabilities for Wi-Fi adapters are: `CoexistenceSupport`, `NumAntennaConnected`, `SimultaneousMultiChannelSupported`, `WLANFunctionLevelDeviceResetSupported`, and `WLANPlatformLevelDeviceResetSupported`.

    The following example shows how you can configure these settings:

    ``` syntax
    <component name="Microsoft-Windows-Wlansvc" processorArchitecture="amd64" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" language="neutral" versionScope="nonSxS" xmlns:wcm="http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
         <NumAntennaConnected>2</NumAntennaConnected>            
         <CoexistenceSupport>1</CoexistenceSupport>
         <SimultaneousMultiChannelSupport>2</ SimultaneousMultiChannelSupport>
         <WLANFunctionLevelDeviceResetSupported>1</WLANFunctionLevelDeviceResetSupported>
         <WLANPlatformLevelDeviceResetSupported>0</WLANPlatformLevelDeviceResetSupported>
    </component>
    ```

-   The `RadioLocation` setting, which specifies the location of the radio feature when a wireless local area network (LAN) connection is used.
