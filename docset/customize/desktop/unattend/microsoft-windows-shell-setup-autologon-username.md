# Username


`Username` specifies a local account or a domain user account on the domain specified by the [Domain](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-autologon-domain.md).

By default, the built-in administrator account is disabled in all default clean installations. You can enable the built-in Administrator account during unattended installations, by setting `Username` to **Administrator** (only the English word will automatically enable the account). This enables the built-in administrator account, even if a password is not specified in [AdministratorPassword](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-useraccounts-administratorpassword.md).

If you are deploying a multilingual Windows image, you should specify account names and group names, by using the language-neutral names. The language-neutral account and group names are specified in English, for example, **Administrators**, **Power Users**, and **Guest**. This is required because the shell account settings are processed before a default user interface (UI) language is applied to the computer.
