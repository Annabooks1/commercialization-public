# SearchContent


**Note**  
In Windows 10, this setting and other [HelpAndSupport](microsoft-windows-helpandsupport-helpandsupport.md) settings are deprecated because the Help component that they impact is being retired. Existing information in this topic is provided for reference only.

For more information on how OEMs can include their customer support contact information in the Contact Support App or Support Web page, see [OEMInformation](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-oeminformation.md).

 

`SearchContent` specifies whether the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or organization has provided offline Help content that **Help and Support** must return in search results.

When an end user performs a search in **Help and Support**, Windows searches for the OEM's offline Help content.
