# ComputerName


`ComputerName` specifies the computer name used to access the computer from the network.

**Note**  
In Windows 10, users can no longer enter a computer name during OOBE as the name is auto-generated. To set a default computer name pre-OOBE, OEMs can configure `ComputerName` in the Unattend.xml file and specify a name for the computer. After OOBE, end users can change this default computer name after OOBE by changing it in the **System Properties** page.

 

## Values


If `ComputerName` is set to an asterisk (\*) or is an empty string, a random computer name will be generated. This random name has at most eight characters from the [RegisteredOwner](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-registeredowner.md) and/or [RegisteredOrganization](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-registeredorganization.md) strings plus random characters.

`ComputerName` is a string with a maximum length of 15 bytes of content:

-   `ComputerName` can use ASCII characters (1 byte each) and/or multi-byte characters such as Kanji, so long as you do not exceed 15 bytes of content.

-   `ComputerName` cannot use spaces or any of the following characters: { | } ~ \[ \\ \] ^ ' : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ ! " \# $ % \` ( ) + / . , \* &, or contain any spaces.

-   `ComputerName` cannot use some non-standard characters, such as emoji.

Computer names that cannot be validated through the DnsValidateName function cannot be used, for example, computer names that only contain numbers (0-9). For more information, see the [DnsValidateName function](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=257040).
