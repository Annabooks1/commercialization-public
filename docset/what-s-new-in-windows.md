# What's new in Windows 10


Welcome to Windows 10! Here are some resources to get you started with the new features that Windows 10 offers.

## Universal Windows driver development


Now you can write one driver that runs on all versions of Windows that share a common set of interfaces. A Universal Windows driver can use Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF), User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) 2 or the Windows Driver Model (WDM). Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10, integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio and Debugging Tools, gives you the tools you need to develop, build, package, deploy, test, and debug drivers that run on multiple Windows 10-based devices. For more information on new features for Universal Windows driver development, see [What's new in driver development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/what-s-new-in-driver-development).

## Windows OneCore


Windows OneCore is a platform for any device—phone, tablet, desktop, or IoT. Windows 10 provides a set of API and DDI interfaces that are common to multiple editions of Windows 10. This set of interfaces is called OneCore. With OneCore, you can also be assured that drivers and apps that are created using OneCore interfaces will run on multiple devices. For more information, see [Getting started with Windows drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/develop/getting-started-with-universal-drivers).

## Continuum


Continuum is a new, adaptive user experience offered in Windows 10 that optimizes the look and behavior of apps and the Windows shell for the physical form factor and customer's usage preferences.

## Cortana device experience


Cortana, the personal assistant technology introduced on Windows 8.1, is now supported on Windows 10 devices. The Speech Platform is used to power all of the speech experiences in Windows 10 such as Cortana and Dictation. To take advantage of the technology, review the guidance and recommendations for the design, development and test of audio input devices intended for use with Microsoft’s Speech Platform.

## Hardware Compatibility program


The new Hardware Compatibility program gives you the opportunity to show your customers that your hardware has met Microsoft's standards for compatibility and reliability. If you’re familiar with Windows 8.1 Hardware Certification, you'll find that the tools and functionality are still available with the new Compatibility Program and the new Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) for Windows 10. You can validate compatibility by testing your product with the Windows HLK tests. And, for IHVs, you can now attest to driver signing and get your hardware listed on the certified product list. This program is designed to increase end users confidence that your products are compatible and reliable with Windows 10. For more information on the Windows HLK for Windows 10, see [Windows Hardware Lab Kit User's Guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn939963.aspx).

For more information on the other kits available for Windows 10, see [Kits and tools overview](kit-and-tools-overview.md) and [What's new in kits and tools](what-s-new-in-kits-and-tools.md).

## New graphical UI for customizing and configuring images


The new Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) provides a graphical user interface that helps you install drivers, set system settings, and add languages and other Windows customizations quickly, so you can install Windows 10 onto test or retail devices. With one tool, hardware developers can create model or reference images, deployment solutions, and device provisioning packages for their mobile, desktop- or IoT-based devices. For more information, see [Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn916113.aspx).

## Internet of Things


Quickly iterate and expand on hardware and software designs with the new edition of the Windows 10. It is specifically for small form factor IoT devices with our without a display. This platform brings Windows to a new class of small devices and allows Makers and Windows developers to leverage best-in-class development and debug tools on a diverse set of hardware resources—including the Raspberry Pi 2. Keep up with the latest information about Windows 10 on Raspberry Pi 2 by registering for the [Windows Developer Program for IoT](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=534228).

## Deploy smaller Windows images, faster


We’ve got new tools that help you save time on the factory floor and space on your hard drives. You can now separately package and apply Windows desktop applications to your images, avoiding some of the time-consuming steps involved in generalizing and recapturing images. You can also use improvements in push-button reset and language packs to save gigabytes on the hard drives. To give the new tools a try, see our [Manufacturing End-to-End Lab](manufacture/desktop/oem-deployment-of-windows-10-for-desktop-editions.md).

## Mobile device management


With the increasing use of smartphones and tablets at work, there is also an increasing burden on IT administrators to manage these mobile devices. Window 10 provides granular mobile device management (MDM) and converged admin controls for PCs and mobile devices that enable easier device management for organizations. The unified mobile device enrollment protocol is aligned across desktop and mobile devices, which provides a more seamless user experience.
