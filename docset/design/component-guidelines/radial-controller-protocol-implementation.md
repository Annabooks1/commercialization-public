# Radial controller protocol implementation

Windows radial controller devices are expected to use the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with the host.

A good understanding of the HID protocol is needed to be able to understand the information presented here. See the following resources for information about the HID protocol:
* [Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID)](http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage#Class_Definitions)
* [HID Usage Tables](http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage#HID_Usage)
* [HID Over I2C Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn642101.aspx)

Windows includes a HID class driver and corresponding HID IÂ²C, HID USB and HID Bluetooth-enabled miniport drivers; therefore, there is no need for any third-party mini-port drivers for Windows radial controllers unless it utilizes a bus where an inbox HID mini-port driver is not available.

A device only needs to report the usages described in this topic in the firmware for a Windows radial controller device. Windows will use the firmware and its own HID drivers to enable the device and give Windows applications access to the device.

A sample descriptor is provided in the [Sample Report Descriptors](radial-controller-sample-report-descriptors.md) section.
