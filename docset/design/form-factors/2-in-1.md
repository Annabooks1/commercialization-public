# 2-in-1


A 2-in-1 form factor is an evolution of the traditional notebook, also know as a convertible notebook that comes in two styles: detachable and convertible. Its key feature is the ability to convert from a traditional notebook to a tablet mode. Convertibles are typically more like a notebook that transforms into a tablet. Detachables are typically more like a tablet with a high quality keyboard base or attachment. Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) introduces a new feature called Continuum that takes advantage of a 2-in-1s unique design. The feature will adjust the user experience based on what mode the device is in. Listed below are a few recommended hardware configurations.
