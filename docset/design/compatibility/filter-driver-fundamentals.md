**Description**

Driver components must not cause the system to crash or leak resources. These resources include, but are not limited to the following: Â 

-   Memory

-   Graphics Device Interface (GDI) or user objects

-   Kernel objects such as files, mutex, semaphore, and device handles

-   Critical sections

-   Disk space

-   Printer handles

*Design Notes*:

Sleep & PNP with IO Before And After Test - Test cycles the system through all sleep states and does basic PNP on all devices on the system.

This test will be run with Driver Verifier enabled with standard settings.
