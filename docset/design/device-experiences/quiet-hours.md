# Quiet hours


Notifications during modern standby and their auditory alerts can be disturbing to some users, particularly in the evening and late night hours. The Quiet hours feature suppresses notifications and helps save battery power. Quiet hours allows the user to define a period of time each day during which notifications and background tasks are suppressed. Users can configure Quiet hours through Cortana or click the **Quiet hours** tile icon in the **Action center** to turn it on or off.

Windows configures Quiet hours for 12 AM to 6 AM local time, by default.
