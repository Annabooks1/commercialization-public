# Modern standby SleepStudy battery information


Each SleepStudy report concludes with information about the system battery configuration. In addition to name and manufacturer, this information includes battery size and design capacity. The battery size and design capacity are particularly important for SleepStudy because they are taken into account when estimating modern standby battery life.

In some cases, the capacity ratio will exceed 100 percent. This is expected and will change over time as the battery chemistry changes.
