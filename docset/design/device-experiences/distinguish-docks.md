When a laptop or a convertible is attached to a USB dock it is essential that the operating system can identify the attached hardware device as “Dock” so that it can deliver the correct user experience. Example: Continuum hinting when a convertible is docked. 
To qualify as a dock, it is essential that the hardware device allows projection to external displays along with support for additional peripherals such as mouse, keyboard, storage etc.  Thus, a USB hub alone or a port replicator does not quality as a dock. 
MS OS Descriptor is only recommended for docks with USB only or USB and Video over standard or proprietary connectors.  (E.g. Surface dock, USB Type C dock).
To indicate that a device is dock to the Windows OS the Extended Properties OS Descriptor can be used. The Extended properties descriptor will create a bitmasked registry key, MSOSDockProperties, which indicates different dock properties, these properties are listed in table 1.

All docks should have the “IsDock” property set properly, and the additional custom properties as needed. The “DockHasIntegratedScreen/Keyboard/Mouse” property should only be used if such a device is physically built into the dock (not if the dock supports this type of connection.) 

#Dock Example
This example demonstrates how an Extended Properties OS Descriptor is used to indicate a device is a dock with a built in mouse, keyboard and monitor to the OS. In this example, by using the returned extended properties descriptors, the MSOSDockProperties DWORD is created under the following registry keys:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB\<DeviceVID&PID> \<DeviceInstance>\Device Parameters
DWORD: MSOSDockProperties = 1

#Header Example
This section illustrates the layout of the header section, which includes the length of the entire descriptor, the number of function sections, and the version number.
