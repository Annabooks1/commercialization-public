# Windows Hello


Microsoft Windows Hello, part of Windows 10, gives users a personal, secured experience where the device is authenticated based on their presence. Users can log in with a look or a touch, with no need for a password. In conjunction with Microsoft Passport, biometric authentication uses fingerprints or facial recognition and is more secure, more personal, and more convenient. Windows Hello can even give users a friendly hello and greet them by name.
