# Get started with Windows 10

Build innovative and differentiated devices with Windows 10. Windows 10 runs on a broad set of devices—from desktops, notebooks, phones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The operating system's common core works across platforms with 80-inch screens, 4-inch screens, or devices with no screens at all.

You can create devices to use touch/pen, mouse/keyboard, controller/gesture—or you can build them to switch between input types.
