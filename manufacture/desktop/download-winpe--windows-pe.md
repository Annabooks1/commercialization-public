# Download WinPE (Windows PE)


To use WinPE, you have to create a USB flash drive, CD, DVD, or virtual hard drive that boots to WinPE.

Files to create WinPE media are distributed as part of the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526803), and are downloaded when you install the ADK with the Windows PE option selected.

## Download WinPE and create bootable media
