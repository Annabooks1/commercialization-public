This Feature on Demand enables Braille devices to work with the inbox Narrator screen reader. Without this Feature on Demand, Braille drivers and translation tables will be missing, causing Braille to no function properly.

### Developer Mode

An on-device diagnostic platform used via a browser.  Installs a SSH server on the device for UWP remote deployment as well as Windows Device Portal.

Enabling Developer Mode will attempt to auto-install this Feature on Demand. On devices that are WSUS-managed, this auto-install will likely fail due to WSUS blocking FOD packages by default. If this Feature on Demand is not successfully installed, device discovery and Device Portal can't be enabled, preventing remote deployment to the device.

**Recommendation:** In general, don't preinstall on devices. If you are building an image for "developer edition" devices, where the primary market for the device is developers or users who plan on developing or testing UWPs, consider preinstalling.
