# Windows Core Operating System (WCOS)

Windows Core Operating System (WCOS) is a version of Windows used to build a wide range of devices, including HoloLens, Xbox, PCs, phones and Nano Servers. It's designed to help you create devices that run apps & drivers built for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) that are more compact, servicable, and secure.

OEMs can manufacture and deploy devices with WCOS using existing or custom-built hardware. To see existing recommended hardware, see the [Hardware Compatibility List](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532948).

When developing your own devices, see the [Minimum hardware requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview).
