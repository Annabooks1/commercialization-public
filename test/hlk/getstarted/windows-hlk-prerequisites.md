# Windows HLK Prerequisites


**Warning**  The Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) should only be installed on machines that are dedicated solely for testing purposes. Do not install any HLK component on a machine that is outside of a dedicated testing environment.

 

**Important**  
Controller setup will fail if .NET Framework 4.5 has not previously been installed. Be sure to install .NET Framework 4.5 from the following location prior to controller setup.

-   <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653>

32-bit SQL Server installations are not supported. You must uninstall any 32-bit SQL Server installation prior to installing the HLK.

SQL Server 2014 is not supported. You must uninstall any SQL Server 2014 installations prior to installing the HLK.

 

Before you begin testing, make sure that the test environment meets the necessary requirements. Windows HLK is comprised of two components: an HLK test server and one or more test systems.

-   **HLK test server.** Often referred to as the *controller*, a test server has two parts: Windows HLK Controller and Windows HLK Studio. The Controller software is the engine that manages tests that are run on test systems. The Studio software is the management tool that lets you select and schedule tests against any test system connected to the test server. Controller and Studio are installed from the Windows HLK installation source. After installation, the test server contains separate installers to install a remote Windows HLK Studio and Windows HLK Client.

    One controller governs a collection of client computers. Controllers can manage and access only the client computers that they govern.

-   **Test system.** Also referred to as a client computer, each test system can have a different configuration that's appropriate for various testing scenarios, including different hardware, operating systems, service packs, and drivers. Each test system can be associated with only one test server. You can configure each test system by running the Windows HLK Client software installer directly from a shared network location on the test server.

## <span id="Deployment_scenarios"></span><span id="deployment_scenarios"></span><span id="DEPLOYMENT_SCENARIOS"></span>Deployment scenarios


There are two deployment scenarios for Windows HLK:

-   **Domain-joined environment.** In a domain-joined environment, a domain controller is present and all computers designated for Windows HLK features are joined to the same domain controller. If you plan to deploy Windows HLK in a domain-joined environment, you need a minimum of three computers: a Windows domain controller, a Windows HLK test server, and at least one Windows HLK test system. Make sure that Microsoft Active Directory® is configured and running on the domain controller. Your domain controller and HLK test server cannot be on the same box.

-   **Workgroup environment.** A workgroup environment has no domain controller. If you plan to deploy Windows HLK in a workgroup, you need at least two computers: a test server and a test system joined to the same workgroup. **Don't** use the Default Administrator account. In this configuration, you must enable the Guest account.

In addition, consider how you want to organize lab resources to best use the Windows HLK. You need to determine the number of test servers and the number of test systems connecting to them. These decisions are partly influenced by the type of devices or systems that you want to test.

To test systems and filter drivers, you need at least 1 test server and 1 test system.

To test external devices, you need at least 1 test server, 1 test system, and the external device(s) to be tested.

You can choose to allocate fewer controllers, each with multiple clients connected to them, if you want less overhead administering the controllers and clients. A maximum of 150 clients can be connected to a single controller. Alternately, you can allocate more controllers and connect fewer clients to them. This allows any given controller to be more responsive because it has fewer clients communicating with it. For more information, see [HLK Controller and Client Organization](p_hlk.hlk_controller_and_client_organization).

The following image shows an example test environment.
