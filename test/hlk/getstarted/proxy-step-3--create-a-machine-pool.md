# Step 3: Create a machine pool


A *machine pool* is a logical grouping of one or more test systems. Before you can work with a test system, you must move it to a working machine pool.

Every project needs a machine pool. A machine pool can be used for multiple projects. A project can reference multiple machine pools.

The following image shows the Studio **Configuration** page.

1.  In Windows HLK Studio, choose **Configuration**.

2.  Select an existing machine pool, and then choose **Create Machine Pool**. Alternatively, you can right-click on an existing machine pool, and choose **Create Machine Pool**.

    Change the default name, if desired, and then press Enter to finish.

    **Note**  Machine Pools can be created at onboarding time for mobile devices.
