The [Windows Hardware Compatibility Program](..\user\windows-hardware-compatibility-program-overview.md) defines a minimum bar for audio quality of devices that have integrated loudspeakers and microphone(s). The Communications Audio Fidelity test verifies that the system meets the hardware certification requirements for a high fidelity audio playback and capture experience.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Audio Device Testing Prerequisites](audio-device-testing-prerequisites.md).

This test requires the following items:

-   One test computer that has at least one microphone and one loudspeaker (referred to as the Device under Test \[DUT\]).

-   One [Polycom CX-100](http://www.polycom.com/products-services/products-for-microsoft/lync-optimized/cx100-desktop-phone.mdl) USB device for reference and measurement.

The test is required for systems that have at least one microphone and one loudspeaker. The test does not require an anechoic chamber; it can be performed in a quiet office environment.

The in-air audio fidelity test is implemented in the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK). The Windows HLK tests play speech signals from the device under test and from a reference device to simulate realistic user scenarios.

You should perform the in-air audio fidelity tests in a typical office environment that has background noise that is less than 35 dBA SPL. Put the device under test (DUT) on a table in a position for typical usage and mount the Polycom CX-100 reference device on a tripod, as shown in *REF \_Ref345316931 \\h Figure 1 Device under Test Setup*. Connect the reference device to the DUT by using a USB connection.
