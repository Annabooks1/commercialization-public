The test attempts to install its upper-filter driver on the target device stack. This attempt results in a query-remove IRP.

If this query-remove IRP fails, the test restarts the computer to get the filter driver onto the device stack. If the remove request is not vetoed, the device stack will be removed and restarted with the filter driver on the device stack.

The test, by using setup APIs, causes a query-remove IRP to be sent to the device stack. The filter driver fails this remove request, so a cancel-remove IRP is sent. The filter driver will assert that the cancel-remove was successful.

Next, the test application calls the appropriate class installer and any registered co-installers to disable or enable and remove or reenumerate the device (this tests the class and co-installers handling of DIF\_PROPERTYCHANGE with DICS\_DISABLE, DICS\_ENABLE, and DICS\_PROPCHANGE). When receiving IRP\_MN\_REMOVE\_DEVICE, the filter driver will assert that the lower drivers completed it successfully.

Each of these steps involves a preliminary remove request. If that request is vetoed, the device will not be removed. You can choose to veto a remove request when appropriate, such as while streaming video on a USB camera or if the target device is in the boot or paging path. Remember that simply failing all remove requests is generally not good practice. Failing all remove requests will not guarantee that driver will never receive a remove because a remove IRP will still be issued after a surprise removal, or if anyone in the device stack fails a start IRP.

-   **Test binary:** Devfund\_PnPDTest.dll
-   **Test method:** PNPCancelRemoveDevice

The Disable Enhanced Device Testing (EDT) Support test uninstalls the test filter driver (msdmfilt.sys) as an upper filter on devices specified using the DQ parameter. This test filter gets installed as part of running tests in this test category.
