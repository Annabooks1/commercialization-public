# Troubleshooting System Fundamentals Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with System.Fundamental tests, follow these steps:

1.  Review the following Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) topics:

    -   [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](p_hlk.troubleshooting_windows_hlk_test_failures)

    -   [WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](wdtf-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md)

2.  Review the [Windows HLK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=236110) for current test issues.

3.  For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.
