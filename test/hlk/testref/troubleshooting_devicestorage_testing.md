# Troubleshooting Device.Storage Testing

To troubleshoot issues that occur with Device.Storage tests, follow these steps:

1.  Review <xref rid="p_hlk.troubleshooting_windows_hlk_test_failures">Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures</b>.

2.  Review one of these Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) topics, depending on the type of storage device or configuration:

    -   <xref rid="p_hlk_test.hard_disk_drive_testing_prerequisites">Hard Disk Drive Testing Prerequisites</b>

    -   <xref rid="p_hlk_test.hardware_based_raid_systems__fibre_channel_sas_scsi_serial_ata__testing_prerequisites">Hardware-based Raid Systems (Fibre Channel, SAS, SCSI, Serial ATA) Testing Prerequisites</b>

    -   <xref rid="p_hlk_test.optical_disk_drive_testing_prerequisites">Optical Disk Drive Testing Prerequisites</b>

    -   <xref rid="p_hlk_test.removable_storage_testing_prerequisites">Removable Storage Testing Prerequisites</b>

    -   <xref rid="p_hlk_test.secure_digital_host_controller_storage_testing_prerequisites">Secure Digital Host Controller Storage Testing Prerequisites</b>

    -   <xref rid="p_hlk_test.storage_adapter_or_controller_testing_overview">Storage Adapter or Controller Testing Overview</b>

3.  Review the <xref hlink="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=236110">Windows HLK release notes</b> for current test issues.

4.  For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

5.  If you observe any failures while running the tests in the Windows HLK, look at the test logs that were generated. For example, for the Enumeration Test, the most relevant log is enumeratedrive.log.wtl. To view this log, go to the **Results** tab in the HLK studio and expand **Enumeration Test** &gt; **Test Run Date and Time** &gt; **Run Test** &gt; **Logs** &gt; **enumeratedrive.log.wtl**.

6.  To debug more, rerun the test manually from the Command Prompt (cmd), while setting the verbosity level to 4. This allows the test to log more information, such as data buffer, CDB information, and sense code. Documentation for each test contains details about the binary that is related to a particular test along with the binary location.

## Optical Storage Device

These are common issues with optical disk drive tests:

-   Some controllers that use Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) mode might cause the CDBs to time out. This time-out occurs most frequently in the Start Stop Unit test, where the CDB after test unit ready times out without any sense code being returned. To resolve the issue, try a different controller or configuration.

-   Some drives intermittently can't delete data from a disk. This issue might be caused by rewritable media that has been used too many times. Try to use new rewritable media.

For more information about how to troubleshoot a test, see the troubleshooting section of a specific test in <xref rid="p_hlk_test.device_storage_tests">Device.Storage Tests</b>.

## Hybrid Information Device

There are special steps that can be taken to reproduce a particular test case in a test, or if necessary, conduct a manual investigation of the device.

1.  Install hybridflt. These files(.inf, .sys, .cat) are found under the same folder as hybriddrive.exe

2.  Enable Storport Tracing

3.  Run hybriddrive.exe
