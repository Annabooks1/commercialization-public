# Troubleshooting Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) Driver Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) driver tests, follow these steps:

1.  Review [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](p_hlk.troubleshooting_windows_hlk_test_failures).

2.  Review the [Windows HLK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=236110) for current test issues.

3.  For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.
