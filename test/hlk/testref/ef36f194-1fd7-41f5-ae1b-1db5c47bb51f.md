As with the removal test, the test application attempts to add an upper filter to the target device stack and then restart the device stack by using **SetupDiCallClassInstaller** with DIF\_PROPERTYCHANGE. If this attempt is not successful (that is, if someone on the target device stack failed the query-remove IRP), the test restarts the computer to test rebalance.

This test initiates a rebalance and also manipulates the resource requirement of the device to maximize the chances that actually new resources are allocated to the device. This option also helps a device with no resources to actually go through the complete rebalance procedure:

1.  First the simple rebalance is started, causing the following IRPs:

    -   IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_STOP\_DEVICE (assuming this IRP is passed by all the drivers. The test already covered the case where this IRP is failed.)
    -   IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS
    -   IRP\_MN\_FILTER\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS. In response to this IRP, while going up, filter driver takes action based on whether the device consumes any resources or not:

        -   If the device has no resource requirement, filter assigns a fake resource.
        -   If the device has a resource requirement, it tries to restructure the resource requirement list in such a way that maximizes the probability of changing the current assignment. For example, if a device needs 2 bytes of memory anywhere between 00 to FF and currently is assigned 3A-3B, modify such that the new resource requirement (in order of preference) looks like 00-39 or 3C-FF or 3A-3B. Similarly if the device resource requirement list has any alternate requirements, it will change their order so the alternate requirement comes earlier in the list.

2.  Now the device should always complete the rebalance procedure.

    IRP\_MN\_STOP\_DEVICE

    IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE (The new allocated resources. If fake requirements were created, mask the new resources from the actual drivers.)

-   **Test method:** PNPTryStopDeviceRequestNewResourcesAndRestartDevice

The Disable Enhanced Device Testing (EDT) Support test uninstalls the test filter driver (msdmfilt.sys) as an upper filter on devices specified using the DQ parameter. This test filter gets installed as part of running tests in this test category
