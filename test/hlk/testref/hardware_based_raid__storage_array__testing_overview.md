# Hardware-based RAID (Storage Array) Testing Overview

Before you begin to test your hardware-based RAID storage array by using the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK), you must review the prerequisites for the type of hardware array that you're testing. For more information, see the documentation that corresponds to the hardware array that you're testing:
