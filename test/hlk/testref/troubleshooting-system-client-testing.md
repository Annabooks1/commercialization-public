# Troubleshooting System Client Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with System.Client tests, follow these steps:

1.  Review the following Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) topics:

    -   [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](..\user\troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md)

    -   [System Client Testing Prerequisites](system-client-testing-prerequisites.md)

2.  Review the [Windows HLK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=236110) for current test issues.

3.  Verify that you have installed the latest Windows HLK filters and kit updates. For more information, see [Windows Hardware Lab Kit Filters](p_hlk.windows_hardware_lab_kit_filters).

4.  For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

5.  If you cannot obtain a successful test result, contact [Windows HLK Support](p_hlk.windows_hlk_support).
