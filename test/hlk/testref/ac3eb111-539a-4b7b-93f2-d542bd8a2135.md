This test validates that the device is running in a Server Core configuration. Server Core is the default installation state of Windows Server which minimizes attack surface, reduces patch frequency, and reduces disk and memory footprint which in turn increases VM density. To pass certification, all device drivers must be supported in Server Core mode, without a dependency on graphical shell binaries. To ensure this requirement is satisfied, the User Interfaces and Infrastructure feature must be "Disabled with Payload Removed."

If you installed the "Full Server" or "Server with a GUI" during Setup, you should reinstall Windows and select the "Server Core Installation" option in Setup to ensure that no traces of Server with a GUI remain on the server running certification. All installation and configuration tests for your driver must be done from within Server Core.

For more information about Server Core configuration, see the following topics:
