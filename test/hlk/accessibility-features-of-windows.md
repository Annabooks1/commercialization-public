# Accessibility Features of Windows


The Windows operating system has many built-in accessibility features that are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, are blind or have low vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features are installed during the installation of Windows. For more information about these features, see Help in Windows and the Microsoft Accessibility website.
